Siddhartha





PENGUIN MODERN CLASSICS
Siddhartha
Hermann Hesse was born in Calw, Germany, in 1877. As a child he lived for a time in Basle. He spent a short period studying at a seminary in Germany but soon left to work as a bookseller in Switzerland. From 1904 he devoted himself to writing. After a first volume of verse (1899), Hesse established his reputation with a series of lyrical romantic novels — Peter Camenzind (1904), Unterm Rad (The Prodigy, 1906), Gertrud (1910) and the short story, Knulp (1915). After a visit to India in 1911 he moved to Switzerland and worked for the Red Cross during the First World War. He was denounced in Germany and settled permanently in Switzerland, where he established himself as one of the greatest literary figures in the German-speaking world. His humanity, his searching philosophy developed further in such novels as Siddhartha (1922), Der Steppenwolf (1927), Narziss and Goldmund (1930) and Das Glasperlenspiel (The Glass Bead Game, 1943), while...

## Introduction



Siddhartha




Introduction
The first time I laid my hands on a copy of Siddhartha was back in 1967. I was twenty years old and had been committed to an asylum by my parents. My girlfriend of the time sent me the book and I remember being sat on my bed and slowly unwrapping the brownish paper. I was heavily sedated and at my first glance of the cover — a white water-lily lazily resting over the surface of a river — I remember wondering: ‘who is this Hermann Hesse?’ I had never heard of him or the tremendous impact this book was making on my generation, but I assumed he was very important, since my teenage girlfriend was sending this to me. Seconds after thinking this I plunged into a deep, dreamless sleep.
When I woke up the white light of the afternoon had gone and I found myself in my cell, looking at a leak in the ceiling. The lights of the cars outside would sometimes illuminate my room and I slowly remembered the presence of the book next to my bed.
Before opening the book I tho...

### PART ONE



#### The Brahmin’s Son



Siddhartha




The Brahmin’s Son
In the shade of the house, in the sunshine on the river bank by the boats, in the shade of the sallow wood and the fig tree, Siddhartha, the handsome Brahmin’s son, grew up with his friend Govinda. The sun browned his slender shoulders on the river bank, while bathing at the holy ablutions, at the holy sacrifices. Shadows passed across his eyes in the mango grove during play, while his mother sang, during his father’s teachings, when with the learned men. Siddhartha had already long taken part in the learned men’s conversations, had engaged in debate with Govinda and had practised the art of contemplation and meditation with him. Already he knew how to pronounce Om silently — this word of words, to say it inwardly with the intake of breath, when breathing out with all his soul, his brow radiating the glow of pure spirit. Already he knew how to recognize Atman within the depth of his being, indestructible, at one with the universe.
There was happiness ...

#### With the Samanas



Siddhartha




With the Samanas
On the evening of that day they overtook the Samanas and requested their company and allegiance. They were accepted.
Siddhartha gave his clothes to a poor Brahmin on the road and only retained his loincloth and earth-coloured unstitched cloak. He only ate once a day and never cooked food. He fasted fourteen days. He fasted twenty-eight days. The flesh disappeared from his legs and cheeks. Strange dreams were reflected in his enlarged eyes. The nails grew long on his thin fingers and a dry, bristly beard appeared on his chin. His glance became icy when he encountered women; his lips curled with contempt when he passed through a town of well-dressed people. He saw businessmen trading, princes going to the hunt, mourners weeping over their dead, prostitutes offering themselves, doctors attending the sick, priests deciding the day for sowing, lovers making love, mothers soothing their children — and all were not worth a passing glance, everything lied, sta...

#### Gotama



Siddhartha




Gotama
In the town of Savathi every child knew the name of the Illustrious Buddha and every house was ready to fill the alms-bowls of Gotama’s silently begging disciples. Near the town was Gotama’s favourite abode, the Jetavana grove, which the rich merchant Anathapindika, a great devotee of the Illustrious One, had presented to him and his followers.
The two young ascetics, in their search for Gotama’s abode, had been referred to this district by tales and answers to their questions, and on their arrival at Savathi, food was offered to them immediately at the first house in front of whose door they stood silently begging. They partook of food and Siddhartha asked the lady who handed him the food:
‘Good lady, we should very much like to know where the Buddha, the Illustrious One, dwells, for we are two Samanas from the forest and have come to see the Perfect One and hear his teachings from his own lips.’
The woman said: ‘You have come to the right place, O Samanas from...

#### Awakening



Siddhartha




Awakening
As Siddhartha left the grove in which the Buddha, the Perfect One, remained, in which Govinda remained, he felt that he had also left his former life behind him in the grove. As he slowly went on his way, his head was full of this thought. He reflected deeply, until this feeling completely overwhelmed him and he reached a point where he recognized causes; for to recognize causes, it seemed to him, is to think, and through thought alone feelings become knowledge and are not lost, but become real and begin to mature.
Siddhartha reflected deeply as he went on his way. He realized that he was no longer a youth; he was now a man. He realized that something had left him, like the old skin that a snake sheds. Something was no longer in him, something that had accompanied him right through his youth and was part of him: this was the desire to have teachers and to listen to their teachings. He had left the last teacher he had met, even he, the greatest and wisest teac...

### PART TWO



#### Kamala



Siddhartha




Kamala
Siddhartha learned something new on every step of his path, for the world was transformed and he was enthralled. He saw the sun rise over forest and mountains and set over the distant palm shore. At night he saw the stars in the heavens and the sickle-shaped moon floating like a boat in the blue. He saw trees, stars, animals, clouds, rainbows, rocks, weeds, flowers, brook and river, the sparkle of dew on bushes in the morning, distant high mountains blue and pale; birds sang, bees hummed, the wind blew gently across the rice fields. All this, coloured and in a thousand different forms, had always been there. The sun and moon had always shone; the rivers had always flowed and the bees had hummed, but in previous times all this had been nothing to Siddhartha but a fleeting and illusive veil before his eyes, regarded with distrust, condemned to be disregarded and ostracized from the thoughts, because it was not reality, because reality lay on the other side of the ...

#### Amongst the People



Siddhartha




Amongst the People
Siddhartha went to see Kamaswami, the merchant, and was shown into a rich house. Servants conducted him across costly carpets to a room where he waited for the master of the house.
Kamaswami came in, a supple, lively man, with greying hair, with clever prudent eyes and a sensual mouth. Master and visitor greeted each other in a friendly manner.
‘I have been told,’ the merchant began, ‘that you are a Brahmin, a learned man, but that you seek service with a merchant. Are you then in need, Brahmin, that you seek service?’
‘No,’ replied Siddhartha, ‘I am not in need and I have never been in need. I have come from the Samanas with whom I lived for a long time.’
‘If you come from the Samanas, how is that you are not in need? Are not all the Samanas completely without possessions?’
‘I possess nothing,’ said Siddhartha, ‘if that is what you mean. I am certainly without possessions, but of my own free will, so I am not in need.’
‘But how will you live if you ...

#### Sansara



Siddhartha




Sansara
For a long time Siddhartha had lived the life of the world without belonging to it. His senses, which he had deadened during his ardent Samana years, were again awakened. He had tasted riches, passion and power, but for a long time he remained a Samana in his heart. Clever Kamala had recognized this. His life was always directed by the art of thinking, waiting and fasting. The people of the world, the ordinary people, were still alien to him, just as he was apart from them.
The years passed by. Enveloped by comfortable circumstances, Siddhartha hardly noticed their passing. He had become rich. He had long possessed a house of his own and his own servants, and a garden on the outskirts of the town, by the river. People liked him, they came to him if they wanted money or advice. However, with the exception of Kamala, he had no close friends.
That glorious, exalted awakening which he had once experienced in his youth, in the days after Gotama’s preaching, after th...

#### By the River



Siddhartha




By the River
Siddhartha wandered into the forest, already far from the town and knew only one thing — that he could not go back, that the life he had lived for many years was past, tasted and drained to a degree of nausea. The songbird was dead; its death, which he had dreamt about, was the bird in his own heart. He was deeply entangled in Sansara, he had drawn nausea and death to himself from all sides, like a sponge that absorbs water until it is full. He was full of ennui, full of misery, full of death; there was nothing left in the world that could attract him, that could give him pleasure and solace.
He wished passionately for oblivion, to be at rest, to be dead. If only a flash of lightning would strike him! If only a tiger would come and eat him! If there were only some wine, some poison, that would give him oblivion, that would make him forget, that would make him sleep and never awaken! Was there any kind of filth with which he had not besmirched himself, any ...

#### The Ferryman



Siddhartha




The Ferryman
I will remain by this river, thought Siddhartha. It is the same river which I crossed on my way to the town. A friendly ferryman took me across. I will go to him. My path once led from his hut to a new life which is now old and dead. May my present path, my new life, start from there!
He looked lovingly into the flowing water, into the transparent green, into the crystal lines of its wonderful design. He saw bright pearls rise from the depths, bubbles swimming on the mirror, sky-blue reflected in them. The river looked at him with a thousand eyes — green, white, crystal, sky-blue. How he loved this river, how it enchanted him, how grateful he was to it! In his heart he heard the newly awakened voice speak, and it said to him: ‘Love this river, stay by it, learn from it.’ Yes, he wanted to learn from it, he wanted to listen to it. It seemed to him that whoever understood this river and its secrets would understand much more, many secrets, all secrets.
But t...

#### The Son



Siddhartha




The Son
Frightened and weeping, the boy had attended his mother’s burial; frightened and gloomy, he had listened to Siddhartha greeting him as his son and making him welcome in Vasudeva’s hut. For days on end he sat with a pale face on the hill of the dead, looked away, locked his heart, fought and strove against his fate.
Siddhartha treated him with consideration and left him alone, for he respected his grief. Siddhartha understood that his son did not know him, that he could not love him as a father. Slowly, he also saw and realized that the eleven-year-old child was a spoilt mother’s boy and had been brought up in the habits of the rich, that he was accustomed to fine food and a soft bed, accustomed to commanding servants. Siddhartha understood that the spoilt and grieving boy could not suddenly be content in a strange and poor place. He did not press him; he did a great deal for him and always saved the best morsels for him. Slowly, by friendly patience, he hoped t...

#### Om



Siddhartha




Om
The wound smarted for a long time. Siddhartha took many travellers across the river who had a son or a daughter with them, and he could not see any of them without envying them, without thinking: So many people possess this very great happiness — why not I? Even wicked people, thieves and robbers, have children, love them and are loved by them, except me. So childishly and illogically did he now reason; so much had he become like the ordinary people.
He now regarded people in a different light from previously: not very clever, not very proud and therefore all the more warm, curious and sympathetic.
When he now took the usual kind of travellers across, businessmen, soldiers and women, they no longer seemed alien to him as they once did. He did not understand or share their thoughts and views, but he shared with them life’s urges and desires. Although he had reached a high stage of self-discipline and bore his last wound well, he now felt as if these ordinary people w...

#### Govinda



Siddhartha




Govinda
Govinda once spent a rest period with some other monks in the pleasure grove which Kamala, the courtesan, had once presented to the followers of Gotama. He heard talk of an old ferryman who lived by the river, a day’s journey away, and whom many considered to be a sage. When Govinda moved on, he chose the path to the ferry, eager to see this ferryman, for although he had lived his life according to the rule and was also regarded with respect by the younger monks for his age and modesty, there was still restlessness in his heart and his seeking was unsatisfied.
He arrived at the river and asked the old man to take him across. When they climbed out of the boat on the other side, he said to the old man: ‘You show much kindness to the monks and pilgrims; you have taken many of us across. Are you not also a seeker of the right path?’
There was a smile in Siddhartha’s old eyes as he said: ‘Do you call yourself a seeker, O venerable one, you who are already advanced i...

Glossary
Agni: is one of the most important of the Vedic gods and has three forms: fire, lightning and sun.
Atman: is a philosophical term used within Hinduism and Vedanta to identify the soul. It is one’s true self beyond identification with the phenomenal reality of worldly existence.
Brahman: is a concept of Hinduism. Brahman is the unchanging, infinite, immanent and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all matter, energy, time, space, being and everything beyond in this universe.
Brahmin: is the first of the four Hindu castes — the caste of priests, of those who know and repeat the Vedas. Brahmins were created from the mouth of Brahma so that they might instruct mankind. This was why they were considered the highest of the four castes, as they had the most to do with the intellect. Since it was recognized that knowledge is the only thing that remains with a person throughout life, Brahmins, as teachers, were duly respected.
Buddha: Gotama, also known ...

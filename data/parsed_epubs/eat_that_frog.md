## Preface



Eat That Frog!




Preface
Thank you for picking up this book. I hope these ideas help you as much as they have helped me and thousands of others. In fact, I hope this book changes your life forever.
There is never enough time to do everything you have to do. You are literally swamped with work and personal responsibilities, endless e-mails, social media, projects, stacks of magazines to read, and piles of books you intend to get to one of these days—as soon as you get caught up.
But the fact is that you are never going to get caught up. You will never get on top of your tasks. You will never get far enough ahead to be able to get to all those e-mails, books, magazines, and leisure-time activities that you dream of.
And forget about solving your time management problems by becoming more productive. No matter how many personal productivity techniques you master, there will always be more to do than you can ever accomplish in the time you have available to you, no matter how much it is...

## Introduction: Eat That Frog



Eat That Frog!




Introduction: Eat That Frog
This is a wonderful time to be alive. There have never been more possibilities and opportunities for you to achieve more of your goals than exist today. As perhaps never before in human history, you are actually drowning in options. In fact, there are so many good things that you can do that your ability to decide among them may be the critical determinant of what you accomplish in life.
If you are like most people today, you are overwhelmed with too much to do and too little time. As you struggle to get caught up, new tasks and responsibilities just keep rolling in, like the waves of the ocean. Because of this, you will never be able to do everything you have to do. You will never be caught up. You will always be behind in some of your tasks and responsibilities, and probably in many of them.
The Need to Be Selective
For this reason, and perhaps more than ever before, your ability to select your most important task at each moment, and t...

## 1 Set the Table



Eat That Frog!




1 Set the Table
There is one quality which one must possess to win, and that is definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants and a burning desire to achieve it.
NAPOLEON HILL
Before you can determine your “frog” and get on with the job of eating it, you have to decide exactly what you want to achieve in each area of your life. Clarity is perhaps the most important concept in personal productivity. The number one reason why some people get more work done faster is because they are absolutely clear about their goals and objectives, and they don’t deviate from them. The greater clarity you have regarding what you want and the steps you will have to take to achieve it, the easier it will be for you to overcome procrastination, eat your frog, and complete the task before you.
A major reason for procrastination and lack of motivation is vagueness, confusion, and fuzzy-mindedness about what you are trying to do and in what order and for what reason. You must a...

## 2 Plan Every Day in Advance



Eat That Frog!




2 Plan Every Day in Advance
Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now.
ALAN LAKEIN
You have heard the old question, “How do you eat an elephant?” The answer is “One bite at a time!”
How do you eat your biggest, ugliest frog? The same way: you break it down into specific step-by-step activities and then you start on the first one.
Your mind, your ability to think, plan, and decide, is your most powerful tool for overcoming procrastination and increasing your productivity. Your ability to set goals, make plans, and take action on them determines the course of your life. The very act of thinking and planning unlocks your mental powers, triggers your creativity, and increases your mental and physical energies.
Conversely, as Alec Mackenzie wrote, “Taking action without thinking things through is a prime source of problems.”
Your ability to make good plans before you act is a measure of your overall competence. The better...

## 3 Apply the 80/20 Rule to Everything



Eat That Frog!




3 Apply the 80/20 Rule to Everything
We always have time enough, if we will but use it aright.
JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE
The 80/20 Rule is one of the most helpful of all concepts of time and life management. It is also called the “Pareto Principle” after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who first wrote about it in 1895. Pareto noticed that people in his society seemed to divide naturally into what he called the “vital few,” the top 20 percent in terms of money and influence, and the “trivial many,” the bottom 80 percent.
He later discovered that virtually all economic activity was subject to this principle as well. For example, this principle says that 20 percent of your activities will account for 80 percent of your results, 20 percent of your customers will account for 80 percent of your sales, 20 percent of your products or services will account for 80 percent of your profits, 20 percent of your tasks will account for 80 percent of the value of what you d...

## 4 Consider the Consequences



Eat That Frog!




4 Consider the Consequences
Every great man has become great, every successful man has succeeded, in proportion as he has confined his powers to one particular channel.
ORISON SWETT MARDEN
The mark of the superior thinker is his or her ability to accurately predict the consequences of doing or not doing something. The potential consequences of any task or activity are the key determinants of how important a task really is to you and to your company. This way of evaluating the significance of a task is how you determine what your next frog really is.
Dr. Edward Banfield of Harvard University, after more than fifty years of research, concluded that a “long time perspective” is the most accurate single predictor of upward social and economic mobility in America. A long time perspective turns out to be more important than family background, education, race, intelligence, connections, or virtually any other single factor in determining your success in life and at work.

## 5 Practice Creative Procrastination



Eat That Frog!




5 Practice Creative Procrastination
Make time for getting big tasks done every day. Plan your daily workload in advance. Single out the relatively few small jobs that absolutely must be done immediately in the morning. Then go directly to the big tasks and pursue them to completion.
BOARDROOM REPORTS
Creative procrastination is one of the most effective of all personal performance techniques. It can change your life.
The fact is that you can’t do everything that you have to do. You have to procrastinate on something. Therefore, deliberately and consciously procrastinate on small tasks. Put off eating smaller or less ugly frogs. Eat the biggest and ugliest frogs before anything else. Do the worst first!
Everyone procrastinates. The difference between high performers and low performers is largely determined by what they choose to procrastinate on.
Since you must procrastinate anyway, decide today to procrastinate on low-value activities. Decide to procrastinate on, o...

## 6 Use the ABCDE Method Continually



Eat That Frog!




6 Use the ABCDE Method Continually
The first law of success is concentration—to bend all the energies to one point, and to go directly to that point, looking neither to the right nor to the left.
WILLIAM MATHEWS
The more thought you invest in planning and setting priorities before you begin, the more important things you will do and the faster you will get them done once you get started. The more important and valuable a task is to you, the more likely you will be motivated to overcome procrastination and launch yourself into the job.
The ABCDE Method is a powerful priority setting technique that you can use every single day. This technique is so simple and effective that it can, all by itself, make you one of the most efficient and effective people in your field.
Think on Paper
The power of this technique lies in its simplicity. Here’s how it works: You start with a list of everything you have to do for the coming day. Think on paper.
You then place an A, B, C, D,...

## 7 Focus on Key Result Areas



Eat That Frog!




7 Focus on Key Result Areas
When every physical and mental resource is focused, one’s power to solve a problem multiplies tremendously.
NORMAN VINCENT PEALE
“Why am I on the payroll?” This is one of the most important questions you can ever ask and answer, over and over again, throughout your career.
As it happens, most people are not sure exactly why they are on the payroll. But if you are not crystal clear about why you are on the payroll and what results you have been hired to accomplish, it is very hard for you to perform at your best, get paid more, and get promoted faster.
In simple terms, you have been hired to get specific results. A wage or a salary is a payment for a specific quality and quantity of work that can be combined with the work of others to create a product or service that customers are willing to pay for.
Your job can be broken down into about five to seven key result areas, seldom more. These represent the results that you absolutely, positiv...

## 8 Apply the Law of Three



Eat That Frog!




8 Apply the Law of Three
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
Three core tasks that you perform contain most of the value that you contribute to your business or organization. Your ability to accurately identify these three key tasks and then to focus on them most of the time is essential for you to perform at your best. Let me tell you a true story.
Three months after her first full-day coaching session with me in San Diego, Cynthia told the group a story: “When I came here ninety days ago, you claimed that you would show me how to double my income and my time off within twelve months. This sounded completely unrealistic, but I was willing to give it a try.
“On the first day, you asked me to write down a list of everything that I did over the course of a week or a month. I came up with seventeen tasks that I was responsible for. My problem was that I was completely overwhelmed with work. I was working ten to twelve hours per day, ...

## 9 Prepare Thoroughly Before You Begin



Eat That Frog!




9 Prepare Thoroughly Before You Begin
No matter what the level of your ability, you have more potential than you can ever develop in a lifetime.
JAMES T. MCCAY
One of the best ways for you to overcome procrastination and get more things done faster is to have everything you need at hand before you begin. When you are fully prepared, you are like a cocked gun or an archer with an arrow pulled back taut in the bow. You will be amazed at what you achieve in the months and years ahead. You just need one small mental push to get started on your highest-value tasks.
This is like getting everything ready to prepare a complete meal. You set all the ingredients out on the counter in front of you and then begin putting the meal together, one step at a time.
Begin by clearing off your desk or workspace so that you have only one task in front of you. If necessary, put everything else on the floor or on a table behind you.
Gather all the information, reports, details, papers, a...

## 10 Take It One Oil Barrel at a Time



Eat That Frog!




10 Take It One Oil Barrel at a Time
Persons with comparatively moderate powers will accomplish much, if they apply themselves wholly and indefatigably to one thing at a time.
SAMUEL SMILES
There is an old saying that “by the yard it’s hard; but inch by inch, anything’s a cinch!”
One of the best ways to overcome procrastination is for you to get your mind off the huge task in front of you and focus on a single action that you can take. One of the best ways to eat a large frog is for you to take it one bite at a time.
Lao-tzu wrote, “A journey of a thousand leagues begins with a single step.” This is a great strategy for overcoming procrastination and getting more things done faster.
Crossing a Great Desert
Many years ago, driving an old Land Rover, I crossed the heart of the Sahara Desert, the Tanezrouft, deep in modern-day Algeria. By that time, the desert had been abandoned by the French for years, and the original refueling stations were empty and shuttered.
The ...

## 11 Upgrade Your Key Skills



Eat That Frog!




11 Upgrade Your Key Skills
The only certain means of success is to render more and better service than is expected of you, no matter what your task may be.
OG MANDINO
Upgrading your skills is one of the most important personal productivity principles of all. Learn what you need to learn so that you can do your work in an excellent fashion. The better you become at eating a particular type of frog, the more likely you are to just plunge in and get it done.
A major reason for procrastination is a feeling of inadequacy, a lack of confidence, or an inability in a key area of a task. Feeling weak or deficient in a single area is enough to discourage you from starting the job at all.
Continually upgrade your skills in your key result areas. Remember, however good you are today, your knowledge and skills are becoming obsolete at a rapid rate. As Pat Riley, the basketball coach, said, “Anytime you stop striving to get better, you’re bound to get worse.”
Never Stop Learning...

## 12 Identify Your Key Constraints



Eat That Frog!




12 Identify Your Key Constraints
Concentrate all your thoughts on the task at hand. The sun’s rays do not burn until brought to a focus.
ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL
Between where you are today and any goal or objective that you want to accomplish, there is one major constraint that must be overcome before you can achieve that major goal. Your job is to identify it clearly.
What is holding you back? What sets the speed at which you achieve your goals? What determines how fast you move from where you are to where you want to go? What stops you or holds you back from eating the frogs that can really make a difference? Why aren’t you at your goal already?
These are some of the most important questions you will ever ask and answer on your way to achieving high levels of personal productivity and effectiveness. Whatever you have to do, there is always a limiting factor that determines how quickly and well you get it done. Your job is to study the task and identify the limiting...

## 13 Put the Pressure on Yourself



Eat That Frog!




13 Put the Pressure on Yourself
The first requisite for success is the ability to apply your physical and mental energies to one problem incessantly without growing weary.
THOMAS EDISON
The world is full of people who are waiting for someone to come along and motivate them to be the kind of people they wish they could be. The problem is that no one is coming to the rescue.
These people are waiting for a bus on a street where no buses pass. If they don’t take charge of their lives and put the pressure on themselves, they can end up waiting forever. And that is what most people do.
Only about 2 percent of people can work entirely without supervision. We call these people “leaders.” This is the kind of person you are meant to be and that you can be, if you decide to be.
To reach your full potential, you must form the habit of putting the pressure on yourself and not waiting for someone else to come along and do it for you. You must choose your own frogs and then make ...

## 14 Motivate Yourself into Action



Eat That Frog!




14 Motivate Yourself into Action
It is in the compelling zest of high adventure and of victory, and of creative action that man finds his supreme joys.
ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUPÉRY
To perform at your best, you must become your own personal cheerleader. You must develop a routine of coaching yourself and encouraging yourself to play at the top of your game.
Most of your emotions, positive or negative, are determined by how you talk to yourself on a minute-to-minute basis. It is not what happens to you but the way that you interpret the things that are happening to you that determines how you feel. Your version of events largely determines whether these events motivate or de-motivate you, whether they energize or de-energize you.
To keep yourself motivated, you must resolve to become a complete optimist. You must decide to respond positively to the words, actions, and reactions of the people and situations around you. You must refuse to let the unavoidable difficulties a...

## 15 Technology Is a Terrible Master



Eat That Frog!




15 Technology Is a Terrible Master
There is more to life than just increasing its speed.
MOHANDAS GANDHI
Technology can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Technology becomes the enemy when we give in to an obsessive need to communicate continually. This compulsion to stay plugged in leaves us all psychologically breathless. We have no time to stop, smell the roses, and collect our thoughts.
You Have a Choice
The key is to keep your relationship with technology under control. Bill Gross, who managed more than $600 billion in fixed-income funds and bonds when he was with PIMCO, is famous for exercising regularly and meditating daily to keep centered while using no technology at all. Despite turning off all his devices, he never misses an important message.
For you to stay calm, clearheaded, and capable of performing at your best, detach on a regular basis from the technology that overwhelms you. A researcher who asked a group of CEOs and entrepreneurs to unplug...

## 16 Technology Is a Wonderful Servant



Eat That Frog!




16 Technology Is a Wonderful Servant
Technology is just a tool.
MELINDA GATES
You must discipline yourself to treat technology as a servant, not as a master. The purpose of technology is to make your life smoother and easier, not to create complexity, confusion, and stress.
Usually, to get more done of higher value, you have to stop doing things of lower value. Keep asking yourself, “What’s important here?” What is most important for you to accomplish at work? What is important in your personal life? If you could do only one or two of the activities available to you, which ones would they be?
Use your technological tools to regularly remind yourself of what is most important and protect yourself from what is least important. Technology can be a simple way to get control of your communications, your time, and even your emotions.
Take Control of Your Communication
Clear your digital workspace as you would your physical desk; close every program not needed for the tas...

## 17 Focus Your Attention



Eat That Frog!




17 Focus Your Attention
All of life is the study of attention; where your attention goes, your life follows.
JIDDU KRISHNAMURTI
Focused attention is the key to high performance. The “attraction of distraction,” the lure of electronic and other interruptions, leads to diffused attention, a wandering mind, a lack of focus, and, ultimately, under-achievement and failure.
Current research proves that continuously responding and reacting to e-mails, telephone calls and texts, and instant messages (IM) has a negative effect on your brain, shortening your attention span and making it difficult, if not impossible, for you to complete the tasks upon which your future and your success depend.1
Developing an Addiction
When you check your e-mail first thing in the morning or when you respond to the bell or other sound that indicates an incoming e-mail or message, your brain releases a tiny shot of dopamine. This shot gives you a pleasant “buzz.” It stimulates your curiosity an...

## 18 Slice and Dice the Task



Eat That Frog!




18 Slice and Dice the Task
The beginning of a habit is like an invisible thread, but every time we repeat the act we strengthen the strand, add to it another filament, until it becomes a great cable and binds us irrevocably, in thought and act.
ORISON SWETT MARDEN
A major reason for procrastinating on big, important tasks is that they appear so large and formidable when you first approach them.
One technique that you can use to cut a big task down to size is the “salami slice” method of getting work done. With this method, you lay out the task in detail, writing down every step in order, and then resolve to do just one slice of the job for the time being, like eating a roll of salami one slice at a time—or like eating an elephant one bite at a time.
Psychologically, you will find it easier to do a single, small piece of a large project than to start on the whole job. Often, once you have started and completed a single part of the job, you will feel like doing just ...

## 19 Create Large Chunks of Time



Eat That Frog!




19 Create Large Chunks of Time
Nothing can add more power to your life than concentrating all of your energies on a limited set of targets.
NIDO QUBEIN
Most of the really important work you do requires large chunks of unbroken time to complete. Your ability to carve out and use these blocks of high-value, highly productive time is central to your ability to make a significant contribution to your work and to your life.
Successful salespeople set aside a specific time period each day to phone prospects. Rather than procrastinating or delaying on a task that they don’t particularly like, they resolve that they will phone for one solid hour—between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m., for example—and they discipline themselves to follow through on their resolution.
Many business executives set aside a specific time each day to call customers directly to get feedback, to return phone calls, or to answer correspondence. Some people allocate specific thirty-to-sixty-minute time periods...

## 20 Develop a Sense of Urgency



Eat That Frog!




20 Develop a Sense of Urgency
Do not wait; the time will never be “just right.” Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.
NAPOLEON HILL
Perhaps the most outwardly identifiable quality of high-performing men and women is action orientation. They are in a hurry to get their key tasks completed.
Highly productive people take the time to think, plan, and set priorities. They then launch quickly and strongly toward their goals and objectives. They work steadily, smoothly, and continuously. As a result, they seem to power through enormous amounts of work in the same amount of time that the average person spends socializing, wasting time, and working on low-value activities.
Getting into “Flow”
When you work on your most important tasks at a high and continuous level of activity, you can actually enter into an amazing mental state called “flow.” Almost everyone has experienced this at ...

## 21 Single Handle Every Task



Eat That Frog!




21 Single Handle Every Task
Herein lies the secret of true power. Learn, by constant practice, how to husband your resources, and to concentrate them at any given moment upon a given point.
JAMES ALLEN
Eat that frog! Every bit of planning, prioritizing, and organizing comes down to this simple concept.
Every great achievement of humankind has been preceded by a long period of hard, concentrated work until the job was done. Your ability to select your most important task, to begin it, and then to concentrate on it single-mindedly until it is complete is the key to high levels of performance and personal productivity.
Once You Get Going, Keep Going
Single handling requires that once you begin, you keep working at the task without diversion or distraction until the job is 100 percent complete. You keep urging yourself onward by repeating the words “Back to work!” over and over whenever you are tempted to stop or do something else.
By concentrating single-mindedly on y...

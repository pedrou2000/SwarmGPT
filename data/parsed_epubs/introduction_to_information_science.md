Praise for Introduction to Information Science, Second Edition
‘The publication of this second edition of David Bawden and Lyn Robinson’s textbook is a major event in information science. The first edition of 2012 established the highest standards; ten years later, the second edition comfortably exceeds all expectations. Quite simply, it is the clearest, most comprehensive and most useful introduction to the field yet produced, and should receive the strongest possible recommendation – equally for those just starting on their studies and for older hands. The vitality and precision with which the authors organize their vast and complex material make the work highly readable, and of course it is bang up-to-date, with chapters analyzing the latest ideas, practices and technologies. Introduction to Information Science has no competition: it is in a class of one. Read it!’

## Preface



Introduction to Information Science







Preface
The aim of this second edition remains that of the first edition: to provide a clear and succinct synthesis of the information science discipline, in as holistic a way as possible; to give the reader a grasp of the basics and a platform to go into all aspects in more depth. It is intended as an overview, showing the scope and the landscape of the subject. We have tried to examine, in reasonably consistent if brief way, all the aspects of the subject and their interrelations, while not allowing details to obscure the whole picture.
As with the first edition, the book is rooted in the scholarly and professional literature, with a substantial number of references. We hope that it may act as a useful sourcebook for the subject and a reminder that no textbook can be an alternative for engagement with the subject’s literature. The conceptual and historical dimensions have been retained, since we feel that it is vital that students and prac...

## Foreword – Curators of Semantic Capital, by Luciano Floridi



Introduction to Information Science







Foreword – Curators of Semantic Capital
Sometimes, a task (from baking a cake to studying the evolution of stars, planets, galaxies, and other objects in the universe) requires only one specific agent to be performed. In this case the agent in question, say A (Alice or astrophysics, in our example), is supposed to be both necessary and sufficient to deliver the required result. A can be the agent and the only agent for that task, and hence her unique identity as the deliverer is uncontroversial. Because she is both necessary and sufficient, she may find her role ethically demanding in two senses. Not only must she deliver but she can also deliver by herself. When things develop, this twofold responsibility may become less clear. A may no longer be sufficient, perhaps she needs to coordinate with other agents, yet she is still necessary, sometimes even more so than in the past.
The debate on the future of Westphalian nation-states seems to su...

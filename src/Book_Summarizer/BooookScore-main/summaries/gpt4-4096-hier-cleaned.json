Stephenson, the Grand Dragon of the largest realm of the KKK. Under his leadership, the Klan infiltrated every corner of Indiana, dominating politics and intimidating citizens. The Klan's influence spread across the United States, with Klan-backed governors in Colorado and Oregon, and numerous Klan members in Congress. The story highlights the resistance against the Klan's rule, led by a few heroic individuals, including two rabbis, an African American publisher, a Catholic lawyer, a small-town editor, and a lone prosecutor.\n\nD.C. Stephenson, a young and ambitious man, joins the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana, quickly rising through the ranks and becoming the Grand Dragon of the Klan of the North. As the Klan continues to grow and gain power, it becomes increasingly violent and oppressive, with members acting as morality police and vigilantes. They would break up parties, search for alcohol, and harass businesses that opened on Sundays. They also served as armed marshals at Klan parades and posted sentries outside polling places on Election Day, intimidating voters.\n\nMadge Oberholtzer, a spirited and independent young woman, becomes involved with the Klan. Despite living just a few blocks from Stephenson's estate, she has never met him before. During their conversation, Stephenson shares his background as a college graduate and war hero, though the details of his past change with each telling. He also boasts about his Midas touch, claiming that everything he gets involved in makes money for him.\n\nAs the story continues, Madge Oberholtzer becomes a key figure in the eventual downfall of D.C. Stephenson. She forces a reckoning and a sensational trial, exposing the man who had enlisted countless Americans to take a pledge of hate. In 1925, the Klan-dominated Indiana General Assembly pursued an ambitious legislative agenda, including a new eugenics law, the abolition of parochial schools, criminal penalties for adultery, state censorship of movies, and mandatory Bible reading in public schools. Despite the corruption and violence associated with the Klan, Stephenson continued to insist that the Republican Party was guided by \"the most lofty motives.\"\n\nIn the trial of D.C. Stephenson for the murder of Madge Oberholtzer, prosecutor Will Remy and his team present evidence against Stephenson, including Madge's dying declaration, testimony from the train porter and hotel workers, and the infected bites on her breasts. They argue that Stephenson had raped and murdered Madge, while the defense claims she had committed suicide or gone on a thrill ride without coercion. The jury finds Stephenson guilty of murder in the second degree, and he is sentenced to life in prison.\n\nStephenson's conviction leads to a rapid decline in the Klan's influence in state government, but the hatred and violence that fueled the organization persist. Throughout the 1920s, the Klan's ideas prevail as the law of the land, with the Immigration Act of 1924 restricting the number of Jews, Catholics, and other minority groups allowed into the United States. This law remains in effect for 41 years. Additionally, Indiana's compulsory sterilization law, which targeted those deemed a threat to the national gene pool, is enforced until 1974.\n\nDespite the decline of the Klan as a mass movement and political force, the hatred and violence it promoted continue to plague American life. In 1930, a mob storms a jail in Marion, Indiana, and lynches two Black teenagers accused of killing a white man and raping his girlfriend. No one is ever charged with the crime, which is witnessed by thousands of Hoosiers in the public square.\n\nYears later, in 1998, a plaque is mounted at the entrance to the courtroom where Stephenson was tried, commemorating the trial's significance in the decline of the Klan's influence. However, the plaque fails to mention Madge Oberholtzer, whose courage as she lay dying from poison exposed the true nature of Stephenson and the Klan. The story serves as a cautionary tale of the dangers of hatred and the power of charismatic individuals like Stephenson to tap into and exploit these emotions for their own gain.\n\nThe story takes place in various locations, including Valparaiso, Indiana, where Valparaiso University is located, and the Vendome Hotel in Evansville, Indiana. Other locations mentioned include Washington, DC, where the Willard Hotel and Washington Hotel are situated, and various states such as Virginia, Wisconsin, and Washington state.", "a-girl-called-samson.epub": "\"A Girl Called Samson\" is a historical fiction novel set during the American Revolution, following the life of Deborah Samson, a young orphan girl living as an indentured servant with the Thomas family in Middleborough, Massachusetts.

Britt believes that Omar is innocent and that the case against him was weak and racially motivated.

Her family lived in a small apartment, and her mother often lamented their poverty.

She also discusses her new friend, who she feels a strong connection with despite their differences. She expresses her fear of losing this friend and being seen as a burden due to her anxiety.

As they part, Lucrezia is left to contemplate her options and the possibility of a different life.\n\nLucrezia's health begins to decline, and Alfonso summons a physician to examine her, hoping she might be pregnant. The physician determines that it is unlikely Lucrezia is with child and recommends a strict regimen of diet, rest, and abstinence from certain activities to improve her health and increase her chances of becoming pregnant. Alfonso, frustrated by the news, confides in the doctor his suspicion that Lucrezia is somehow preventing pregnancy through her willpower or a flaw in her character. The doctor dismisses this notion, attributing her condition to an excess of heat in her blood, which he believes can be treated through bleeding, cupping, and herbal remedies.\n\nAs Lucrezia eavesdrops on their conversation, she contemplates the many sides of Alfonso's personality and struggles to reconcile his recent acts of cruelty with his current kindness and concern for her well-being.

The story revolves around the British man-of-war ship, the Wager, and its crew, who embark on a secret mission led by Commodore George Anson to capture a treasure-filled Spanish galleon. The protagonist, David Cheap, a first lieutenant who dreams of becoming a captain and escaping his troubled past, is part of the squadron that includes the ships Centurion, Pearl, Gloucester, and others. The British fleet faces many challenges, including a shortage of available crew members, leading to the use of press gangs to forcibly kidnap seafaring men and press them into service.\n\nAs the squadron sets sail, they encounter various challenges, such as storms, sickness, and the loss of ships. The Wager, commanded by Captain Cheap, is shipwrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. Most of the officers and crew perish, but 81 survivors set out in a makeshift boat to find help. After a harrowing journey, 30 of them miraculously reach Brazil, where they are celebrated for their bravery and ingenuity. Six months later, another boat carrying three more survivors lands in Chile, accusing the earlier group of being mutineers and revealing the horrifying events that took place on the island.\n\nThe castaways on Wager Island, including Captain Cheap, gunner John Bulkeley, midshipman John Byron, and others, struggle to survive in the harsh conditions, facing hunger, cold, and internal conflicts. The crew members begin to fracture into warring factions, with some blaming Captain Cheap for their predicament and questioning his authority. Bulkeley emerges as a key figure in the group, leading an excavation team and constructing a large dwelling for himself and other warrant officers. The castaways encounter a group of Kaw\u00e9sqar people, who are skilled navigators and have adapted well to the harsh environment. The castaways realize that these indigenous people might hold the key to their salvation. Despite initial hesitation, the Kaw\u00e9sqar eventually approach the castaways and teach them their methods of survival and provide them with food.\n\nAs the castaways continue to work together to survive, tensions rise between Captain Cheap and the men, particularly with Mitchell and his gang causing trouble. The castaways are faced with a choice between following Captain Cheap's plan to find the commodore and complete their mission or supporting Bulkeley's plan to sail through the Strait of Magellan to Brazil. Most of the crew sign a petition supporting Bulkeley's plan, but Captain Cheap refuses to sign and remains adamant about his original orders. The castaways remain divided, with tensions escalating as both factions gather weapons and prepare for potential conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, Anson and his remaining ship, Centurion, continue their expedition and eventually intercept and capture a Spanish galleon filled with treasure, boosting the nation's morale and earning Anson a promotion. Back on Wager Island, Cheap and the remaining men, including Lieutenant Hamilton, try to repair their boats to rejoin Anson. As they face challenges, they resign themselves to their fate. Bulkeley's group, now in the Strait of Magellan, face their own hardships, but eventually reach Brazil. They become paranoid about conflicting stories and accusations, moving to different lodging places to escape threats. Baynes, the ranking officer, accuses Bulkeley and Cummins of leading the mutiny against Cheap. Bulkeley and Cummins secure passage home, awaiting their court-martial trial.\n\nThe story then shifts to the survivors' return to England, where they face a court-martial.

The accused publish their conflicting accounts of the events, each trying to sway the public and the Admiralty in their favor.

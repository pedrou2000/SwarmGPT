    "a-girl-called-samson.epub": "Deborah Sampson, who disguised herself as a man to fight in the American Revolution, falls ill in Philadelphia and is taken care of by Dr. Binney. She is eventually brought to Paterson House in Lenox, Massachusetts, where she becomes close to General Paterson's late wife's daughters. Deborah plans to put on a production where she will wear her uniform and talk about the war from a female perspective. Agrippa Hull, a close friend of General Paterson, warns Deborah against running away. General Paterson returns home, and Deborah realizes that she cannot continue as they have been and have another child. Deborah tells General Paterson that she wants to tell her story and perform her production, even if it costs him his good name and their son's name. General Paterson supports her and Deborah arranges a tour of Boston, Providence, Albany, and New York, where she performs drills and gives a public lecture about women's contributions to the Revolution.\n\nDeborah also returns to her hometown of Middleborough and speaks at two churches, where she is a curiosity more than a favorite son. While in Middleborough, Deborah visits her former caretaker, Mrs. Thomas, and her son, Benjamin, who gives Deborah a box of her old letters and suggests she compile them into a book. Deborah later returns to Paterson House and grows old with General Paterson, who becomes a judge and is trusted by the people. Deborah writes her final letter to her friend Elizabeth, who is buried beside the willow tree, and reflects on her life. She remembers her service as a soldier and how it has left a mark on her, even as she has embraced every role in life, including being a mother and a wife. Despite the challenges she faced, Deborah is proud of her accomplishments and the mark she has made on the world.\n\nGeneral Paterson was described as a strapping, handsome man of Scottish descent, six foot two and athletic, who remained in his position until everyone else was sent home. He was made a major general at the close of his duty. John Paterson was an only son, the youngest in a family of five sisters, with a military father who passed away from yellow fever in service to the Crown. Deborah adored him and was greatly impressed by his dedication. His relationship and fondness for Agrippa Hull, a celebrated African American soldier of the Revolution, was noted in the records.\n\nDeborah's leg troubled her for the rest of her life, though she was tireless until the end, always doing and striving. When people met her, they were often surprised by her appearance, expecting \"a Samson instead of a Deborah.\" According to her friend Elizabeth, Deborah was born December 17, 1760, not 1759, and she was indeed a descendant of William Bradford, whose accounts of the Pilgrim story have been passed down through the ages. Her heritage, on both sides of her family, began there, and it was deeply personal and important to her. She was indentured at a young age because her father, Jonathan Sampson, abandoned his family, a wife and five children. Deborah's relationship with her mother was almost nonexistent, though the Thomas family lived in Middleborough, not far from Plympton. Reverend Sylvanus Conant helped arrange the bond of servitude, which was very common in those days. Her intelligence and abilities were a joy to him, and he did his best to shepherd her and give her what he could.\n\nDeborah's regiment, her commanding officers, and some of the names of men who served with her are all part of the historical record. James (Jimmy) Battles, Noble Sperin, and John Beebe all died at Tarrytown and were in Deborah's company. There is some doubt whether Deborah enlisted in April of 1781 or April of 1782. If she enlisted in 1782, she did not serve in Yorktown, though the book by Mann has her there. It hardly matters. Her service in the war was truly remarkable, and her stamina and grit even more so. Deborah married a man named Benjamin Gannet a few years after the war and had three children (Earl, Mary, and Patience) and adopted another, an indentured servant girl named Susanna.",

    "yellowface.epub": "Juniper Song, a successful writer, is accused of plagiarism by literary critic Adele Sparks-Sato, who presents evidence that the first paragraph of Juniper's latest novella is a word-for-word copy of an unpublished story by Athena Liu. Juniper denies it, but faces negative comments and death threats on social media, leading her to consider quitting writing. She becomes increasingly anxious about the Instagram post and thinks that Athena might still be alive. She remembers a time when Athena attended one of her readings and wonders if Athena faked her own death. Geoffrey advises Juniper to work on something else and leave Athena's shadow behind, but she finds herself typing \"Chinese ghosts\" into Google Scholar and learns about the Chinese culture's obsession with death. She starts devouring Chinese ghost stories and learns that so many Chinese ghosts are angry, voiceless women.\n\nJuniper writes a fictionalized version of herself and Athena Liu, describing the night Athena died, how she stole her work, and every step along her way to literary stardom, and then her horrifying fall. Despite the scandal, Juniper's book sales increase. She finds herself imagining ways that Athena might still be alive and stalking her. She convinces herself that Athena could have faked her choking and hired those EMTs, and that this could all be one grand literary hoax. Juniper learns about Chinese ghosts and tries to find a way to exorcise Athena's ghost.\n\nJuniper receives an Instagram notification from Athena's ghost, which leads her to the Exorcist steps.

She starts to worry that Athena might be in danger. Juniper confesses to Athena that she can't do this anymore, and when Athena responds, her voice has changed once again.

Candice wants Juniper to confess to stealing Athena's work and ruining her life, and Juniper is left feeling helpless and vulnerable. The whole thing costs Juniper thousands of dollars even after insurance, and she wakes up to no police, investigators, or journalists standing over her bedside. An anonymous Good Samaritan found her and called the EMTs using the emergency feature on her phone, but they'd disappeared by the time the ambulance arrived. Candice has played this perfectly, leaving Juniper with no room to suspect foul play.\n\nJuniper starts planning her next steps, including writing a proposal and drafting a memoir that will expose the rotten foundations of the literary industry and make her the hero. She intends to make Athena the leech, the vampire, the ghost who wouldn't let her go, and Candice her deranged wannabe proxy. Juniper is innocent and only guilty of loving literature too much and refusing to let Athena's work go to waste. She plans to submit the manuscript for publication and expects it to sell for more money than any of her previous works."

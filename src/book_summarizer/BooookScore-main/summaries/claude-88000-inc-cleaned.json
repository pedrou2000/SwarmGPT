She feels more vulnerable without her parents alive to protect and support her. The narrator recalls her father laughing when his coworkers jokingly called him \"over the hill\" at his 40th birthday party. In contrast, no one made jokes about the narrator's age when she turned 40, as it was also her first birthday without her parents. \n\nThe narrator feels her parents' absence makes her more prone to anything happening to her, quoting a poem about parents taking the first blows for their children. She dreads routine physicals now, anxious about being diagnosed with something serious like her parents were in their 40s. Every new ache makes her wonder if it's the start of a bigger problem. The narrator's friends share their own health issues, but she imagines her mother brushing them off, insisting the narrator is still young. \n\nThe narrator wishes her mother was still alive so they could talk about getting older. She remembers telling her mother about monitoring her blood sugar, implying she may develop diabetes like her father. The narrator wonders if aging would feel easier if she could experience it alongside her mother. She longs for her parents' protection and support in facing new health challenges. Their deaths have left her feeling profoundly vulnerable. The narrator concludes that her grief and anxiety about aging are intertwined, both stemming from the loss of her parents.\n\nThe narrator's father was 67 when he died from complications of diabetes.

She confides that sometimes it seems impossible to surpass the age they reached before their deaths.\n\nThe narrator's obsession with matching her parents' ages continues as she recounts significant life events. She notes crossing the line of nearly failing the glucose test during both her pregnancies, just as her mother did. Her blood sugar never returned to normal after that. The narrator was diagnosed with diabetes, the disease that killed her father, but she avoided telling her ill mother to prevent further upset. However, the narrator did confide about monitoring her blood sugar, prompting her mother to insist she was still young despite the implication of diabetes. Her mother's reassurance gave her momentary comfort.\n\nThe narrator still cringes at routine physicals, each one a reminder of her parents' mortality and her own vulnerability. She ties her anxiety directly to her grief over her parents' deaths, left unprotected without them. The narrator's deep connection to her parents manifests in her inability to imagine outliving them or reaching old age alone without their guidance.

    "homecoming.epub": "Nora Turner-Bridges was staying with her pregnant sister-in-law Isabel Turner in Tambilla, South Australia for Christmas in 1959. Nora noticed that Isabel was suffering from insomnia and forgetfulness, leaving her baby unattended at times, but chalked it up to stress and loneliness with her husband Thomas away. On Christmas Eve morning, Nora saw Isabel drop and shatter her treasured teacup from childhood in the garden. She then went to greet her awakening nieces and nephew\u2014Matilda, John and Evie. Meanwhile, young local Becky Baker was heading to work at the Turner house. She ran into Meg Summers at the grocery store, who gifted Becky a pink jacket for the Turners' baby Thea and mentioned her son Kurt was on the phone, likely with Matilda. Becky saw Kurt afterward looking upset. The phone call was confirmed by Marian at the telephone exchange, who noted a call from the Turner house to the Summers' that morning. Police later became interested in this call between Kurt and Matilda. Nora planned to take Isabel out to tea to cheer her up after Christmas. \n\nThat same day, Isabel took her children on a picnic to a nearby creek. Tragically, she murdered her four children by poisoning them before killing herself at the creek. The children's bodies were found by Percy Summers, Meg's husband. He was deeply disturbed by the sight but did not see any sign of Thea's baby crib at the scene. Upon returning home, a distraught Meg revealed to Percy that she had been walking by the creek earlier and found baby Thea alive. She had secretly brought the baby home without telling anyone. Percy was shocked and insisted the baby had to be returned. However, he soon realized taking Thea back now would implicate his wife, who had no explanation for being at the crime scene or taking the baby.\n\nPercy decided to keep Thea's survival a secret until he could anonymously leave her somewhere to be found safely. He did not tell his sons Marcus and Kurt about the baby. The police continued searching for Thea, believing she had been taken by wild dogs. Sergeant Duke from Adelaide grew suspicious during his interview with Percy, wondering if Meg's footprints had been found at the picnic site. Percy returned to the creek that night and saw the earth was sodden from heavy rain, erasing any evidence. He struggled to understand his wife's actions but knew they were now tangled in a web of lies and secrecy. \n\nDespite his guilt over the deception, Percy was relieved the heavy rain had likely washed away any proof of Meg being at the picnic site that afternoon. After interviewing Percy again and getting his statement, Sergeant Duke revealed the police had found prints from a man's boot near the baby's crib. This made Percy realize the police suspected him, not Meg, of taking Thea based on the boot print matching his own. Percy decided he had to change his statement to admit he had approached the crib that day, making it more plausible the print was his. He went back to the police and amended his statement. Sergeant Duke seemed satisfied but mentioned they would soon find the missing baby. \n\nPercy grew anxious as more time passed with no sign of Thea being discovered. He wondered whether Becky Baker had been right when she accused Nora of taking the baby. Percy recalled that Nora's own child had died around the same time. He began to suspect Nora found Thea and raised her as her own daughter Polly. This would explain why no one else had reported finding the baby. Percy was left to wrestle with the consequences of his well-intentioned but flawed attempt to protect the child.",

She hires consultant Will, not realizing he is the same Will from her past. Fern is distrustful of Will at first and resists his advice, believing he represents the corporate interests threatening her family business. \n\nWill is also suspicious of Fern's motives for hiring him, thinking she wants to sabotage his plans to modernize the resort so it fails. However, they eventually open up to each other again, admitting they never forgot their brief but meaningful encounter years before. A close friendship develops and they share information about their difficult family relationships and career frustrations. \n\nTheir mutual passion is reignited, complicated by the secrets they still keep from each other.

Fern realizes Will intentionally deceived her about their past connection. Furious and betrayed, she ends their new relationship abruptly.

    "pathogenesis-a-history-of-the-world-in-eight-plagues.epub": "The Industrial Revolution brought about unprecedented economic growth and technological innovation in Britain over the course of the 19th century. However, industrialization did not automatically lead to improved standards of living or health for most people. In fact, life expectancy stagnated through much of the 1800s due to the horrible living conditions endured by the urban working classes. \n\nAs the population boomed and people flooded into industrializing cities like Manchester and Liverpool, overcrowding and lack of sanitation led to frequent outbreaks of diseases like tuberculosis, typhoid, and cholera. The mortality rate was staggering, especially among the poor - in some cities life expectancy was as low as 15 years for factory workers. Conditions were nightmarish, with entire families living cramped into single rooms in dilapidated tenement housing. Human waste overflowed in the streets due to lack of sewage systems. Rampant alcoholism and domestic abuse were common side effects of the misery. \n\nDespite creating unprecedented wealth, the new capitalist economy did little to improve public health or infrastructure in the first phase of the Industrial Revolution. Not until the late 19th century did life expectancy start to rise, as piecemeal reforms addressed some of the worst aspects of squalor and disease. But for decades, infectious diseases thrived due to the disruption of traditional rural life and the deprived, overcrowded living conditions created by rapid urbanization and industrialization. The benefits of economic growth failed to reach the masses toiling in the factories and slums.  \n\nIn the mid-19th century London had no way to deal with the tons of excrement its three million inhabitants produced each day. As Charles Dickens pointed out in Little Dorrit, \"Through the heart of the town a deadly sewer ebbed and flowed, in the place of a fine fresh river.\" The lack of proper sanitation meant that cholera outbreaks were common. When the disease returned to London in 1848, it killed over 14,000 people - twice as many as in the first outbreak years earlier.\n\nAfter this public health disaster, the British government finally passed legislation in 1848 that forced London's municipal authorities to build a sewerage system that transported human waste far beyond the city limits. This massive underground project used 318 million bricks to construct 82 miles of tunnels and finally put London at the forefront of sanitation engineering in Europe. Although the sewers addressed the immediate crisis, London remained the exception. Most other British cities resisted spending money on public health infrastructure like clean water and sanitation systems.  \n\nIt wasn't until after the Second Reform Act of 1867, which greatly expanded voting rights, that municipal governments began improving public health on a large scale. Newly enfranchised urban workers supported local politicians who promised to invest in water and sewage projects. Within a couple of decades, death rates tumbled as cities built modern sanitation infrastructure. But it took sustained political action, not just economic growth, to spread the benefits of industrialization to the masses and overcome the early decades of disruption, disease and death.",

Bolien was last seen at a remote eastern platform, leading to suspicions that he voluntarily stepped off the edge into the planet's crushing atmosphere. \n\nMossa and Pleiti visit Bolien's colleagues and learn he was arrogant and self-important, enthusiastic about his research into organism altitude adaptation, but showed no signs of despondency. Five days prior, Pleiti glimpsed Bolien at the station looking harried when she was returning from the nearby Preservation Institute, which hosts living specimens of ancient Earth species. \n\nMossa and Pleiti go to the Institute, seeking information on Bolien's last visit.

Pleiti subdues the man, revealed to be Professor Porbal. \n\nMossa is badly injured. As Pleiti tries to help her, a countdown warns that a rocket launch is imminent. They discover the Rector preparing the rocket, which Pleiti realizes contains the stolen genetic samples, meant to seed life on Earth and sabotage years of ecosystem planning. Though Mossa tries to stop him, the Rector knocks her down again and boards the rocket as it launches. Pleiti manages to get himself and Mossa to safety in time. They have prevented the immediate destruction of their life's work and revealed the shocking extent of the Rector's unethical actions.

    "the-wager-a-tale-of-shipwreck-mutiny-and-murder.epub": "The British commodore George Anson led an expedition in 1740 with six ships to attack Spanish settlements and shipping in the Pacific. One of the ships, the Wager, was wrecked off the coast of Chile in 1741. The 140 survivors led by Lieutenant David Cheap made it to an island, where they faced starvation and internal power struggles. The gunner John Bulkeley emerged as the leader of a faction seeking to leave the island rather than continue the expedition. After failed attempts to depart, Bulkeley led a mutiny against Cheap in 1742. Most of the men made it in a small boat to the mainland and eventually back to England in 1743. \n\nBulkeley published his journal defending his actions and accusing Cheap of misconduct. Meanwhile, Anson continued the expedition with his sole remaining seaworthy ship, the Centurion. In 1743 off the Philippines, he spotted and gave chase to the Spanish treasure galleon Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Covadonga. After an intense battle, Anson prevailed despite being outnumbered, capturing a massive treasure haul including tons of silver and gold. This was the largest ever seized by the British navy and a triumph for Anson after his earlier disasters.\n\nWith Anson's return to England in 1744, attention focused again on the alleged mutiny on the Wager. In early 1746, the Admiralty ordered a court-martial of the surviving officers and crew. Bulkeley was imprisoned until the trial. When it began, the judges surprisingly only questioned the men about the loss of the Wager itself, not the later alleged crimes on the island. The verdict absolved both Cheap and Bulkeley of responsibility for the wreck. There was no adjudication of the mutiny accusations or the shooting of an unarmed man by Cheap. The causes for the limited scope remain unclear, but the navy may have wanted to avoid airing details that undermined claims of British moral superiority. The sordid affair was essentially erased from the record, allowing the glorified story of Anson's capture of the Spanish treasure to prevail.",

    "while-time-remains.epub": "The excerpt is from a memoir titled While Time Remains by Yeonmi Park, a North Korean defector and human rights activist. The section describes Park's move to New York City in November 2014 at age 21 and the culture shock she experiences as a refugee adjusting to American life. \n\nPark recounts arriving at JFK airport and being stunned by the majestic, towering skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline, which seem both impressive yet frightening compared to her small North Korean hometown of Hyesan. The bright lights and massive billboards of Times Square in particular leave her awestruck, reminding her of North Korean propaganda about the US as a place that will \"glow in the dark\" after being bombed. Even mundane aspects of American life like grocery stores overwhelm Park with their material abundance and countless options for any given product. She finds the obsession with dieting and intentional food restriction absurd given her malnutrition in North Korea. American social concepts around relationships, mental health, fitness, and more also baffle Park initially.\n\nAs a Columbia University student, Park faces further culture shock in the school's focus on creating \"safe spaces\" free of controversial ideas or \"triggering\" content. Orientation emphasizes avoiding emotional discomfort over intellectual debate. Park sees parallels to her North Korean education in the insistence on conforming to certain approved ideas and rooting out hidden oppressors or dissenters. Classes critique Western civilization and figures like Jane Austen as racist or misogynistic. Park becomes increasingly disillusioned with the university's dogmatic ideology, feeling it promotes groupthink rather than critical analysis.\n\nDespite the challenges, Park remains exhilarated by the possibilities of life in America. She dreams of studying economics and experiencing true romantic love without social barriers. Her early relationships and friendships introduce her to New York's diversity. However, Park also notices many friends struggling to find commitment from men focused on casual dating. She reflects that male gender roles in North Korea center on protecting and providing for women. In America, Park observes ongoing racial tensions and growing political polarization as the 2016 election approaches. She supports Hillary Clinton, fearing Donald Trump represents a fascist threat. Yet Park holds out hope that her new homeland will help her promote human rights and find purpose.",

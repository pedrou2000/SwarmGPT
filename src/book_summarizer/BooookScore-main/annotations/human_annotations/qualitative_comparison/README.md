- The `pilot` folder contains annotations for 20 summary pairs collected during the pilot study, and the `formal` folder contains annotations for the other 80 summary pairs collected during a formal study with better-formulated annotation requirements.
    - In the pilot study, we ask annotators to write 4 short paragraphs comparing the two summaries in the following 4 aspects:
        1. Level of detail
        2. Overall structure and pacing
        3. Logic and understandability
        4. Whether there are contradictions between the two summaries, or if some important information is present in one summary but omitted in the other
    - In the formal study, we ask the following 7 questions, each soliciting an answer to a multiple choice question (with 3 available choices: Summary 1, Summary 2, Draw) and a short paragraph explaining their choice:
        1. Which summary has a higher level of detail?
        2. Which summary has better structure and pacing?
        3. Which summary has better logic and understandability?
        4. Are there contradictions between the two summaries?
        5. Does summary 1 omit information that is present in summary 2?
        6. Does summary 2 omit information that is present in summary 1?
        7. Which summary do you prefer?

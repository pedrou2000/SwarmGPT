Stephenson, the powerful Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in 1920s Indiana. Exploiting the deep-seated prejudices of the region, Stephenson's Klan gains personal wealth and power while encountering Madge Oberholtzer, who eventually forces a reckoning against him. As the Klan's influence spreads, Jews, Catholics, and African Americans in Indiana suffer persecution at the hands of the Klan. Rabbi Morris Feuerlicht and others begin to challenge the organization's power.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Stephenson has grandiose plans, aiming to eventually take control of the White House. Indiana becomes a hotbed of Klan activity, with thousands of members marching in parades and cross burnings attended by tens of thousands of people. Despite the pervasive racism and intolerance, a uniquely American music, jazz, emerges from the heart of Klan country and spreads across the nation, breaking barriers and bringing people together.\n\nIrish-American lawyer Patrick H. O'Donnell combats the Klan by organizing a coalition of groups to resist its influence, founding the American Unity League and starting a weekly newspaper, Tolerance. O'Donnell's insider sources provide him with the secretive membership rolls of the Klan, which he publishes in Tolerance, exposing prominent community members and stirring up public outrage against the organization. As the struggle against the Klan intensifies, Stephenson's power and influence begin to be challenged.\n\nStephenson remains confident and aims to take control of Valparaiso University, a financially struggling institution, to create a \"one hundred percent American\" curriculum for a new generation of Klan members. In this era of heightened racial tensions, influential figures like James W. Johnson, leader of the NAACP, argue against the Klan's beliefs and emphasize the importance of contributions from all racial and ethnic groups.\n\nStephenson hosts a lavish party aboard his yacht, the Reomar II, for influential politicians and leaders. His ultimate goal is to have the Klan control the White House, and he discusses strategies with Imperial Wizard Evans, including backing political candidates who support the Klan's racist and exclusionary beliefs. Meanwhile, Klan violence continues to escalate, with cross burnings, bombings, and attacks on minority groups.\n\nStephenson's influence wanes when he kidnaps Madge Oberholtzer, who fights back against his violent sexual assault. The violent incident threatens to expose his criminal behavior and destroy his political ambitions, leaving the future of the Klan uncertain. Madge's life hangs in the balance as she is subjected to further abuse and humiliation, while Stephenson desperately tries to keep her alive to avoid a murder charge. As Madge's mother, Matilda, and her friend Ermina Moore search for her and confront Stephenson, the Grand Dragon's web of deceit begins to unravel. A dying Madge signs a declaration detailing her ordeal with Stephenson, which, if admissible in court, could ultimately lead to his conviction and the downfall of his once-powerful organization.\n\nAs public opinion begins to turn against the Klan, Stephenson attempts to downplay the charges against him, even mocking the situation during his brief stay in jail. Meanwhile, women rally against him, demanding justice for Madge. With an upcoming election in Indianapolis, Stephenson's influence is put to the test, and the Klan's mayoral candidate, John L. Duvall, wins the primary. However, the incident with Madge continues to cast a long shadow over Stephenson's political future and the Klan itself. As more women come forward with stories of abuse, the Klan's once-invincible position in Indiana seems to be faltering, with the impending trial of Stephenson set to begin in October.\n\nThe trial begins, and prosecutor Remy reads Madge's dying declaration to the jury, detailing her horrific ordeal. As the courtroom hangs on her words, Stephenson's legal team attempts to discredit her testimony and cast doubt on her character. Despite their efforts, Stephenson is found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison, effectively ending his reign of power and signaling a potential defeat for the Klan's stranglehold on Indiana. Madge Oberholtzer's bravery and determination prove to be the catalyst for Stephenson's downfall and a turning point in the fight against the Klan in Indiana. The story highlights the tragic consequences of hate and intolerance and the courage of those who fought against it in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.\n\nIn the aftermath of Stephenson's conviction, the Klan's power begins to wane across the United States, with many of its leaders and members exposed and prosecuted for their crimes. The organization's influence rapidly declines, and its once-formidable presence in American politics and society fades. As the story concludes, the fight against hate and intolerance continues, but the bravery and determination of individuals like Madge Oberholtzer and Patrick H. O'Donnell serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up against oppression and injustice.","summary_2":"\"A Fever in the Heartland\" is a historical account of the Ku Klux Klan's rise to power in Indiana during the 1920s, focusing on the life of David C. Stephenson, the Grand Dragon of the largest realm of the KKK. Under his leadership, the Klan infiltrated every corner of Indiana, dominating politics and intimidating citizens. The Klan's influence spread across the United States, with Klan-backed governors in Colorado and Oregon, and numerous Klan members in Congress. The story highlights the resistance against the Klan's rule, led by a few heroic individuals, including two rabbis, an African American publisher, a Catholic lawyer, a small-town editor, and a lone prosecutor.\n\nD.C. Stephenson, a young and ambitious man, joins the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana, quickly rising through the ranks and becoming the Grand Dragon of the Klan of the North. As the Klan continues to grow and gain power, it becomes increasingly violent and oppressive, with members acting as morality police and vigilantes. They would break up parties, search for alcohol, and harass businesses that opened on Sundays. They also served as armed marshals at Klan parades and posted sentries outside polling places on Election Day, intimidating voters.\n\nMadge Oberholtzer, a spirited and independent young woman, becomes involved with the Klan. Despite living just a few blocks from Stephenson's estate, she has never met him before. During their conversation, Stephenson shares his background as a college graduate and war hero, though the details of his past change with each telling. He also boasts about his Midas touch, claiming that everything he gets involved in makes money for him.\n\nAs the story continues, Madge Oberholtzer becomes a key figure in the eventual downfall of D.C. Stephenson. She forces a reckoning and a sensational trial, exposing the man who had enlisted countless Americans to take a pledge of hate. In 1925, the Klan-dominated Indiana General Assembly pursued an ambitious legislative agenda, including a new eugenics law, the abolition of parochial schools, criminal penalties for adultery, state censorship of movies, and mandatory Bible reading in public schools. Despite the corruption and violence associated with the Klan, Stephenson continued to insist that the Republican Party was guided by \"the most lofty motives.\"\n\nIn the trial of D.C. Stephenson for the murder of Madge Oberholtzer, prosecutor Will Remy and his team present evidence against Stephenson, including Madge's dying declaration, testimony from the train porter and hotel workers, and the infected bites on her breasts. They argue that Stephenson had raped and murdered Madge, while the defense claims she had committed suicide or gone on a thrill ride without coercion. The jury finds Stephenson guilty of murder in the second degree, and he is sentenced to life in prison.\n\nStephenson's conviction leads to a rapid decline in the Klan's influence in state government, but the hatred and violence that fueled the organization persist. Throughout the 1920s, the Klan's ideas prevail as the law of the land, with the Immigration Act of 1924 restricting the number of Jews, Catholics, and other minority groups allowed into the United States. This law remains in effect for 41 years. Additionally, Indiana's compulsory sterilization law, which targeted those deemed a threat to the national gene pool, is enforced until 1974.\n\nDespite the decline of the Klan as a mass movement and political force, the hatred and violence it promoted continue to plague American life. In 1930, a mob storms a jail in Marion, Indiana, and lynches two Black teenagers accused of killing a white man and raping his girlfriend. No one is ever charged with the crime, which is witnessed by thousands of Hoosiers in the public square.\n\nYears later, in 1998, a plaque is mounted at the entrance to the courtroom where Stephenson was tried, commemorating the trial's significance in the decline of the Klan's influence. However, the plaque fails to mention Madge Oberholtzer, whose courage as she lay dying from poison exposed the true nature of Stephenson and the Klan. The story serves as a cautionary tale of the dangers of hatred and the power of charismatic individuals like Stephenson to tap into and exploit these emotions for their own gain.\n\nThe story takes place in various locations, including Valparaiso, Indiana, where Valparaiso University is located, and the Vendome Hotel in Evansville, Indiana. Other locations mentioned include Washington, DC, where the Willard Hotel and Washington Hotel are situated, and various states such as Virginia, Wisconsin, and Washington state."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:48:39.752032Z","updated_at":"2023-09-25T12:10:34.389365Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":57,"updated_by":8,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6613,"annotations":[{"id":2354,"completed_by":8,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"ru2-KXlQxa","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 2 is more detailed in the sense that it gives more background to several of the events.

She forms close bonds with the youngest Thomas brother, Jeremiah, and Reverend Sylvanus Conant, who cares for her well-being and education. Deborah also begins a correspondence with Elizabeth Paterson, the niece of Reverend Conant, who encourages her to pursue her dreams and shares her own experiences.\n\nAs the colonies face increasing political turmoil, Deborah becomes more curious about the situation and seeks answers from Elizabeth and her husband, John Paterson, a delegate to the Massachusetts congress. Inspired by the Declaration of Independence and its promise of \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" Deborah wonders if these rights extend to women like her and is eager to contribute to the cause.

As she grows older, she forms a bond with Jeremiah, the youngest Thomas brother, corresponds with her pen pal Elizabeth, and becomes interested in the political conflicts in the colonies. Nathaniel, the eldest Thomas brother, confronts Deborah about their unresolved romantic tension, urging her to choose him as a suitor. When war seems imminent, the sound of distant cannon fire from the Battle of Bunker Hill intensifies the situation and awakens a sense of adventure in Deborah and the Thomas brothers.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Deborah loses Reverend Conant and the Thomas brothers Nathaniel, Elijah, Edward, and David in various battles. Deborah becomes a schoolteacher in Middleborough but struggles with her mother's push for her to marry wealthy Mr. Crewe. In a moment of defiance, Deborah decides to become a soldier instead and disguises herself as a man named Elias Paterson, but she's discovered and faces consequences. Despite this, she enlists as Robert Shurtliff in the Fourth Massachusetts Regiment, where she marches under Captain George Webb to West Point. There, Deborah discovers her former pen pal Elizabeth's husband, John Paterson, is base commander.\n\nDeborah's company scouts Westchester's enemy-held no-man's-land but is relegated to gathering supplies and transporting goods. As their mission becomes more secretive, Deborah struggles with her growing attraction to General Paterson. When their encampment is attacked, Deborah alerts her company and helps fend off DeLancey's Brigade. The war continues, with Deborah constantly at risk of her true identity being discovered while determined to serve her cause.\n\nAfter night combat leaves Deborah's friends Noble, Jimmy, and Beebe dead, General Paterson helps Deborah stitch a wound on her arm, and they share a moment of understanding. When Captain Webb informs Deborah that General Paterson seeks an aide, she seizes the opportunity despite the risks of being closer to the general. As his aide, Deborah gains a comfortable living situation, works with Colonel Kosciuszko, and maintains her secret identity.\n\nGeneral Paterson discovers Deborah's true identity as a woman and confronts her about her deception. Despite her pleas to stay, his decision remains uncertain. After days of waiting, General Paterson allows her to continue serving as his aide, but they maintain strict professionalism and distance.\n\nAs the war continues, Deborah navigates her new status and the threat of discovery while proving herself as a capable soldier. During a celebration, Captain Webb brings news of a possible uprising, and General Paterson takes action, although the instigator Davis Dornan escapes. Deborah encounters Phineas, an old friend now serving as a soldier, and they share a bittersweet reunion. General Washington deals with the consequences of a vote to hang a British prisoner as retribution, while Davis Dornan is captured after an attempt to kill Washington's African valet, resulting in further complications for Deborah and her fellow soldiers.\n\nGeneral Paterson confesses his love for Deborah, revealing that he is in love with her despite her being nothing like his late wife, Elizabeth. He admits that he finds her impossibly, undeniably, and irresistibly beautiful, but is troubled by his feelings for her. They share a passionate kiss, but the general ultimately decides that he cannot be near Deborah any longer. He tells her that he will dismiss her as his aide once the situation in Philadelphia is resolved and that she will not have to return to the highlands. Despite her love for him, Deborah is heartbroken by his decision.\n\nDuring their journey, Deborah and General Paterson struggle with their feelings for each other and the complications their relationship creates. They share passionate moments and tender confessions, but the general remains conflicted about his love for Deborah. As they near their destination, Deborah becomes more desperate to stay with the general, even though he continues to insist on dismissing her.

Isabelle recalls having an emotional affair with Ben during Allison's memorial, which led to their eventual marriage. She questions Waylon's motives for helping her and wonders if he is trying to protect Ben or uncover the truth about Allison's death.

Later, Isabelle's husband Ben confronts her about the conference and their differing views on Mason's case, causing tension as they argue about the possibility of Mason still being alive. Ben reveals he's seeing someone new, causing Isabelle further pain and forcing her to reflect on their past relationship.\n\nIsabelle struggles with the negative comments and scrutiny she faces as a mother of a missing child. On the day of Mason's vigil, she takes a walk to clear her head, passing her old office at The Grit and reminiscing about her time there. She reunites with her former mentor Kasey, who offers her support and an open invitation to reconnect with their old coworkers. At a bistro called Framboise, Isabelle meets with Waylon again, considering his offer to share her story on his podcast. They discuss the details of Mason's kidnapping and Isabelle's theories. She is concerned about a mysterious comment on an article related to her son's case, which later disappears.\n\nFollowing Waylon's advice, she takes a walk around her neighborhood and encounters an unresponsive elderly man, leaving her feeling unsettled. Later, Waylon visits Isabelle's home to record their podcast interview, during which they discuss the case in detail and reveal their personal reasons for their involvement in true crime. Isabelle begins to suspect her neighbor might be connected to Mason's disappearance and remains determined to find the truth despite facing threats from him.\n\nDuring a conversation with Waylon, she learns about a cold case he solved involving a missing child taken by a town crossing guard. This strengthens Isabelle's suspicions about her neighbor. As she reflects on her relationship with Ben and their time together before his first wife Allison's passing, she realizes she never knew the full extent of his life with her. Isabelle shares her guilt over Allison's possible accidental overdose with Waylon, who asks whether there could be a connection between Allison's death and Mason's kidnapping. Isabelle admits that she struggled emotionally as a new mother, and Waylon's probing questions force her to confront the darker aspects of her past, including possible connections between Allison's death and Mason's disappearance.\n\nIn a shocking twist, Isabelle realizes Waylon sought her out at TrueCrimeCon and managed to infiltrate her life, raising her suspicions about his true intentions. Their relationship becomes strained as Waylon admits he believes Isabelle is responsible for Mason's kidnapping. Feeling betrayed, Isabelle kicks Waylon out and resolves to continue her search for the truth about Mason's disappearance on her own.\n\nIsabelle visits Ben, hoping to find answers about Mason. She discovers Ben now lives with Valerie, a woman she had previously met at a church support group. Ben insists their relationship began after he and Isabelle separated, offering her no new information. Upset, Isabelle decides to return to her hometown of Beaufort to confront her past, as well as search for answers about her sister Margaret's death and Mason's kidnapping.\n\nIn Beaufort, Isabelle struggles with memories of her sister and her life before tragedy struck her family. After a tense dinner with her parents, she discovers their relationships have become strained since Margaret's death and her separation from Ben. Isabelle becomes determined to uncover the truth about Margaret's death and Mason's kidnapping. She confronts her mother about Margaret's death and uncovers a dark family secret about her mother's depression and a previous attempt to kill them. Isabelle learns that her father knew about her mother's attempt and chose not to get help for her to protect his reputation.\n\nIsabelle's search for the truth about Mason's disappearance is further complicated when she discovers that Waylon is Allison's brother, leading her to question his motives and her own involvement in Mason's kidnapping. Despite this revelation and facing her own dark past, Isabelle remains determined to find answers and uncover the truth behind her son's disappearance and the tragedies that have struck her family.\n\nIsabelle confronts Valerie, hoping to warn her about Ben and find common ground. She tries to explain the dangers of being involved with Ben, but Valerie remains defensive and hesitant to listen. As Isabelle continues to search for answers, she becomes more and more convinced that Ben played a role in both Allison's death and Mason's disappearance. She realizes that Ben never wanted to be a father and that he may have orchestrated the kidnapping to avoid being tied down by parenthood. With this newfound knowledge, Isabelle is determined to bring Ben to justice and uncover the truth about her son's disappearance and the tragedies that have struck her family.\n\nIn a tense confrontation with Valerie, Isabelle accuses her of taking her son and demands to know where he is. Valerie denies any involvement in Mason's kidnapping, justifying her relationship with Ben by claiming that neither he nor Isabelle truly wanted to be parents. Despite Valerie's refusal to reveal any information about Mason, Isabelle remains steadfast in her determination to uncover the truth about her son's disappearance and bring those responsible to justice.\n\nIsabelle meets with Ben in prison, where he insists he did not kill Valerie and has no idea how his ring ended up at the crime scene. Isabelle accuses Ben of knowing about the dead baby monitor, implying that he told Valerie which night to kidnap Mason. Ben remains silent, and Isabelle remains determined to uncover the truth about her son's disappearance and the tragedies that have struck her family."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:48:39.752681Z","updated_at":"2023-09-25T18:11:44.766820Z","inner_id":7,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":57,"updated_by":8,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6619,"annotations":[{"id":2360,"completed_by":8,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"u6DSunNG__","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 2 provides more details as it gives more information about other characters, like Zeke.

As Ander and Santi grow closer, they navigate their feelings for each other while maintaining a \"just friends\" status. They bond over shared interests and experiences, such as cooking, art, and their Mexican heritage.

Following a prophecy about marriage being her undoing, Artemis tasks Atalanta with joining Jason and the Argo crew to retrieve the Golden Fleece.\n\nOn her journey, Atalanta befriends Meleager, who supports her despite resistance from others. They encounter Queen Hypsipyle, who requests the Argonauts to stay with the women of her island. Atalanta insists on leaving, and they continue their journey, eventually facing and defeating six-armed giants. At a stop on the Mysian coast, Heracles loses his companion Hylas and stays behind, while the crew continues their quest. They later find four shipwrecked men related to Aeëtes, keeper of the Golden Fleece, and convince them to join the crew. They reach Colchis, where Jason challenges Aeëtes for the Golden Fleece and succeeds with the help of Aeëtes's daughter Medea and her magical salve.\n\nMeleager invites Atalanta to join the hunt for a giant boar terrorizing his hometown, Calydon.

Grieving, Atalanta wanders, eventually reaching a village where she seeks direction towards the Arcadian forest.\n\nAtalanta finds refuge with an aging huntsman and his wife, giving birth to Meleager's son, Parthenopaios. She hunts in the village outskirts, adjusting to her new life. She encounters Hippomenes again, who has been tracking her. He reveals the heroes of the Argo have gone their separate ways and that their tales often leave out Atalanta's contributions. She realizes she is no longer bound by promises to Artemis and can decide her own fate.\n\nAt a pool, Atalanta and Hippomenes discuss their desires for adventure and reluctance to return to their homes. Accepting her past and new life with her son, Atalanta contemplates her future outside of Artemis's influence. They journey to the palace of King Iasus, Atalanta's father, who has sent a message seeking his daughter. They are received coldly, and Atalanta wonders about his intentions.

She becomes a skilled hunter under Artemis' tutelage and learns about the dangers of men and the history of the gods. Artemis warns Atalanta of a prophecy stating that marriage will be her undoing and advises her to remain a virgin.\n\nAtalanta joins the Argonauts, a group of heroes led by Jason, on a quest to find the Golden Fleece. She becomes close with Meleager, an Argonaut who accepts her into their ranks without question. During their journey, they face various challenges, including battles with giants, navigating treacherous waters, and participating in funeral games. Atalanta and Meleager grow closer, sharing an intimate moment despite their previous commitments to remain chaste.\n\nThe crew arrives at the island of Lemnos, where they are greeted by an army of women, led by Queen Hypsipyle. Jason and the majority of the crew accept Hypsipyle's invitation to share their hospitality, while Atalanta, Heracles, Hylas, and Meleager remain behind, suspicious of the women's intentions. Atalanta decides to sneak into the city to check on her crewmates and encounters Hypsipyle, who reveals the dark past of Lemnos and the women's desire for the Argonauts to stay with them. Despite her skepticism, Atalanta agrees to walk with Hypsipyle through the city, learning more about the queen and her people. The Argonauts eventually leave Lemnos and continue their journey.\n\nAs the Argonauts approach the treacherous waters of the Symplegades, they manage to navigate through the rocks safely with the help of a dove. They then land on a quiet shore to rest and recover from their ordeal. Atalanta and Meleager share a moment of relief and gratitude, but their respite is interrupted by a wild boar attack that fatally wounds their comrade, Idmon. The crew mourns the loss of Idmon and their helmsman, Tiphys.\n\nThe Argonauts encounter the sons of Phrixus, who agree to join the crew in their quest for the Golden Fleece in exchange for help in reclaiming their father's kingdom in Greece. The crew sets out to find the temple of Ares on the Isle of Ares, where they hope to gain the god's favor for their journey.\n\nIn Colchis, King Aeëtes agrees to give Jason the Golden Fleece if he can complete a seemingly impossible task. Medea, Aeëtes' daughter, helps Jason by providing him with a magical salve that protects him during the task. They succeed in obtaining the Fleece and flee, pursued by Aeëtes's forces. Medea and Jason eventually marry on the island of Drepane.\n\nAtalanta and Meleager return to Pagasae, where they find the city deserted and discover that Medea and Jason have murdered King Pelias. They decide to stay for the funeral rites before making any decisions about their future. Atalanta and Meleager travel to Calydon to hunt a ferocious boar sent by Artemis as punishment for King Oeneus neglecting her worship. During the hunt, Meleager confesses his love for Atalanta and proposes they leave their current lives behind to be together, but she refuses, citing her vow to never marry.\n\nAtalanta is forced to participate in a race where the suitors who lose will be executed. She deliberately loses the race to save the lives of the other runners, including her friend Hippomenes. Atalanta and Hippomenes leave the town and stumble upon an overgrown temple dedicated to Rhea, the mother of gods. As they explore the temple, they become entranced by the heavy scent of roses, which they recognize as a sign of Aphrodite's presence and her punishment for their disregard of the Golden Apples.\n\nAtalanta finds herself pregnant and unable to return to her home in the Arcadian woods due to a broken vow to Artemis. She gives birth to a son, Parthenopaios, and leaves him with villagers to be raised. Atalanta meets Hippomenes, who helps her with her journey, and they develop a bond. Hippomenes brings news that Atalanta's father, King Iasus, is looking for her. Atalanta is initially reluctant to meet her father, who had abandoned her as a child, but eventually decides to go in hopes of securing a better future for her son.\n\nKing Iasus puts Atalanta to the test by asking her to perform an archery feat, which she accomplishes with ease. He then declares her as his daughter and announces that he will find a husband for her through a footrace, with the condition that any man who loses the race will lose his life. Atalanta, who has sworn never to marry, accepts the challenge, believing that no man can outrun her. During the race, Hippomenes uses Golden Apples of the Hesperides, a divine gift from Aphrodite, to distract Atalanta and gain an advantage. However, she chooses to save Hippomenes and the other racers from death by losing the race deliberately.\n\nAtalanta and Hippomenes are transformed into lions by Rhea for defiling her temple. As lions, they feel more powerful and free than ever before, and they revel in their new forms. Atalanta is grateful for her new life and feels more herself than ever before. The story ends with Atalanta reflecting on her journey and embracing her new life as a lion, wild and free."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:48:39.752881Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T06:51:31.620128Z","inner_id":9,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":57,"updated_by":8,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6621,"annotations":[{"id":2362,"completed_by":8,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"89ULzHD-A6","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 2 has more details that allow us to see the bigger picture.

Alex is recovering from a falling out with her former best friend, Wren, and is anxious about the possibility of running into her at the retreat. The two had bonded over their shared love for author Roza Vallo and their own writing projects before their friendship ended after a confrontation at a bar and a regrettable sexual encounter. At the retreat, Alex meets fellow attendees Taylor, Keira, and Poppy, forming friendships and discussing their writing projects. However, tension remains between Alex and Wren, who is also attending the retreat.\n\nRoza announces a competition where each writer must complete a new novel within a month, with the winner receiving a one million dollar advance, a book tour, and their novel published with an introduction by Roza herself. Alex struggles with writer's block and is encouraged by Roza to use her pain and experiences to fuel her writing. She begins working on a historical fiction novel about a woman named Daphne, who claimed to channel a demoness named Lamia. As the retreat progresses, Alex continues to feel isolated and envious of the close friendships and pairings among the other participants.\n\nDuring a Valentine's Day party hosted by Roza, the punch is spiked with LSD, causing tension and altered perceptions among the group. Poppy convinces Alex to follow her into the basement, claiming she has found proof that Roza is not who she claims to be. In the basement, Alex has a vivid hallucination of being in a forest with her best friend Christina, encountering Lamia, a powerful and seductive creature who shares an intimate and potentially dangerous moment with her. The next morning, Poppy is missing, and Alex and Wren decide to search for her in the basement. They find a tube of peppermint lip balm and learn that Poppy's real name is Zoe Canard. They suspect that Zoe scammed her way into the retreat by convincing the real Poppy not to come. Alex and Wren discover a hidden keypad in the basement, marking the spot for future reference. Their conversation turns into an argument about their personal issues, and Wren leaves Alex alone in the basement.\n\nThroughout the story, Alex grapples with her feelings for Wren, her sexual identity, and her desire to belong. She also struggles with the challenges of the intense writing competition and the expectations placed upon her by Roza. The retreat forces Alex to confront her past, her fears, and her creative potential, all while navigating the complex relationships and dynamics among the other participants. The group becomes increasingly paranoid and distrustful of Roza and her staff after discovering hidden cameras and a secret room. They attempt to contact the police, but are unable to do so due to the remote location and lack of phone or radio access.\n\nIn a series of dramatic events, Keira escapes to get help, while Alex and Wren are held captive by Roza and Taylor, who force them to write novels for their own gain. The captives try to escape, but are ultimately caught and locked in a dungeon. Roza offers Alex a deal: if she kills Wren, she will be allowed to live and publish her book, while also enjoying a luxurious life under Roza's guidance. Alex refuses the deal and manages to poison Roza and Taylor with wolfsbane, leading to a final confrontation where Keira returns to help Alex and Wren.\n\nSix months after the traumatic event, Alex attends her book launch, where she reads an excerpt from her novel and reconnects with old friends and colleagues. Despite the horrific actions of Roza, Alex acknowledges the impact she had on her life, inspiring her to write and create something beautiful from her pain. Alex decides to continue writing in secret for Roza, and begins working on a new project. The protagonist's first novel, The Writing Retreat, is a testament to the power of creativity and the importance of the people in their lives."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:48:39.753562Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T11:00:23.556864Z","inner_id":16,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":57,"updated_by":8,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6628,"annotations":[{"id":2369,"completed_by":8,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"tDylTzLT6z","from_name":"structure","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"2616jvjuwp","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 1 provides more information about the events that take place during the mother-daughter trip.

The story begins with Laurie landing a major account for her agency, Boujee Cosmetics, worth seventy million dollars. However, just as she is about to celebrate her success, she receives a call from her mother, who informs her that she is in the hospital.\n\nLaurie rushes to her mother's side at Ridgefield Hospital in New Jersey, where she finds her looking frail and vulnerable. Dr. Ormson had checked herself into the ER after experiencing chest pains and wants to leave the hospital, but the staff refuses to release her without a doctor's approval. Dr. Malcolm Akers, her cardiologist, informs her that she may have had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) at some point and strongly recommends that she stay for further tests. Seeing her mother's spirits crushed, Laurie offers to take a trip with her once she is released from the hospital. This seems to lift Dr. Ormson's spirits, and she agrees to stay for the tests.\n\nLaurie and her mother embark on a 14-day trip to Norway, where Dr. Ormson was born, and Paris, a city Laurie loves but associates with her failed marriage to Andrew. During their trip, they visit various sights, bond over shared experiences, and confront the challenges of their relationship. They also meet Richard, a charming British man whom Laurie becomes infatuated with. However, Richard later reveals that he is married and has three daughters, leaving Laurie heartbroken.\n\nThroughout their journey, Laurie reflects on her past relationship with Andrew, her insecurities, and her evolving relationship with her mother. Dr. Ormson admits to Laurie that she never felt the strong maternal love she believes she should have felt for her daughter, as she was always more interested in the rational and factual side of things. She also shares her own experiences with love, loss, and moving on, which mirror Laurie's situation with her ex-husband. Despite their differences, Laurie and her mother find common ground and grow closer during their trip.\n\nIn reality, Dr. Ormson suffers a silent heart attack and is hospitalized in New Jersey. Despite her condition, she insists on going to Paris with Laurie. Dr. Akers advises her to stay in the hospital for more tests, but she refuses. In the middle of the night, Laurie receives a call from the hospital, informing her that her mother's condition has worsened. She rushes to the hospital, where she finds her mother unconscious and hooked up to machines. Despite the doctors' efforts, Dr. Ormson passes away, leaving Laurie devastated and alone.\n\nAfter her mother's death, Laurie finds a sealed envelope addressed to her among her mother's belongings. The letter expresses Dr. Ormson's appreciation for Laurie's efforts to reconnect with her and how touched she was by the gesture. The story ends with Laurie grieving for her mother and reflecting on the bond they shared during their imagined trip to Norway.\n\nFour years later, Laurie reflects on her mother's letter and the journey she took after her mother's death. Initially reluctant to take the trip alone, Laurie eventually followed her therapist's advice and went on the journey. She visited Paris, where she had a whirlwind romance that ultimately did not last, and met her mother's family, who welcomed her with open arms. Throughout the trip, Laurie often thought about what her mother would say or do in various situations, and she found comfort in these imaginary conversations.\n\nAfter returning from the trip, Laurie met a man named Rob, whom she eventually married. Together, they have a two-year-old son named Eli. Laurie continues to have conversations with her mother in her head, seeking guidance and wisdom. She realizes that people give what they have to give, and sometimes that can be enough.

Along with their business partner Marx, who is Sam's roommate and friend, they form a gaming company called Unfair Games. Sadie becomes involved in a complicated relationship with Dov, her former professor and a well-known game designer, who becomes involved in the project as a producer and equity partner.\n\nAs Ichigo gains popularity, Sam is seen as the game's auteur, overshadowing Sadie's contributions. They begin working on a sequel, Ichigo II: Go, Ichigo, Go, which receives modest sales but is seen as a step backward creatively. Sadie decides she does not want to make a third Ichigo game, causing tension between her and Sam. They eventually reconcile and begin brainstorming a new game called Both Sides, which toggles between two worlds, one where the player is an ordinary person and the other where they are a hero.\n\nMarx, concerned about Sam's health, insists that he go to the doctor. The doctor recommends that Sam have his foot amputated, as it is no longer sustainable and poses a risk of sepsis. However, Sam refuses to have the surgery, stating that he needs to work on the new game with Sadie first. Marx and Sadie discuss moving their game development company to California, where the warmer climate and better accessibility would make it easier for Sam to recover from surgery. They decide to relocate, and Sam agrees to have the surgery in California.\n\nBefore leaving for California, Sadie breaks away from her relationship with Dov, who tries unsuccessfully to convince her to stay.

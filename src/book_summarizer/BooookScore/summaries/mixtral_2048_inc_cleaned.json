The War of Twelve Shields ends with the defeat and execution of Verthing Bloodblade, and Bardholt 'Battlebold' Hraustr is declared the first King of Hr\u00f3th. In exchange for the betrothal of his daughter Brenna to Einlek \u00d3thling, Heryon Vattenvarg pledges his loyalty to Bardholt I and is named Steward of Mentendon, bringing Mentendon into Virtudom.\n\nThe plot follows a group of protagonists on their adventures. Tunuva Melim, a Priory warrior hailing from Carmentum, discovers her celestial lineage and, together with Canthe, a stellar magic-wielding witch, protects granaries from otherworldly beings and saves her kin. Canthe had earlier kidnapped Wulf, a soon-to-be knight named Sir Wulfert Glenn, intending to breed a guardian heir for the forests.\n\nIn the South, we are introduced to the magical realms where the story begins. The dominant polytheistic religion of Lasia believes in the Orchard of Divinities, the afterlife, and a pantheon of gods. The Faith of Dwyn is followed by the Mirrorfolk, a collective term for teachers, followers, and scholars.\n\nThe North is home to the Hr\u00f3thi people, who follow the Virtues of Knighthood, a faith founded by Galian Berethnet. The kingdom of Inys, located in the West, is ruled by the House of Berethnet. The H\u00fcran, a group of nomads in the North, are descendants of stragglers who arrived from a land called Brhazat.\n\nThe Seiiki realms, in the East, have their own unique elements.

The Klan's influence expanded across the United States, infiltrating various levels of government, judiciaries, and law enforcement agencies, with significant impacts in Indiana, Ohio, Colorado, and Columbus, Indiana.\n\nThe Klan's expansion was facilitated by key figures like D.C. Stephenson, the Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan, who aimed to become the President of the United States in 1924. Stephenson, a resident of Hamilton County, was known for his successful mass movement, parties, and corruption. He shared a complex relationship with his wife, Nettie Brehm, who was a significant figure in the story.\n\nStephenson's legal team, including James R. Crowe, Charles Davenport, and Ed Jackson, attempted to defend him in court. However, he was convicted for assault and jailed, following the kidnapping and death of Madge Oberholtzer in Iowa, which exposed the Klan's corruption. Stephenson's wives, Jeanette \"Nettie\" Brehm and Florence Catherine, were also affected by his actions.\n\nThe Klan's influence peaked in the 1920s, aided by cooperation with the American Unity League, the American Breeders Association, and the Anti-Saloon League during Prohibition, where they promoted eugenics. Key figures in the Klan were also present within the US Congress, House of Representatives, and Senate.\n\nThe Klan's decline began following opposition from various sources like journalists Thomas Adams, politicians John Rutledge and Edwin K. Steers, and Kansas newspaperman William Allen White, who banned the Klan in his state in 1922. The prosecutor, William H. Stern, played a crucial role in assembling a case against Stephenson, defending Oberholtzer's character, and refusing to obey Stephenson's demands, despite facing challenges such as death threats, the need for protection, and the refusal of sheriffs to arrest Klansmen.\n\nOther characters in the story include Harry Rowbottom, a member of the American Unity League, and Caleb Ridley, an Indiana politician. The prosecutor's death, which occurred later in the story, was a significant event, highlighting the challenges faced in the fight against the Klan.\n\nThe US Constitution, its amendments, and various institutions played significant roles in the story. The 15th Amendment, granting African American men the right to vote, and the 18th Amendment, enforcing Prohibition, had notable mentions. The US Congress, House of Representatives, Senate, US Treasury Department, Valparaiso University, and the USS Tennessee were also mentioned, providing context to the story's settings and characters.\n\nNotable figures like Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Lincoln, journalist Oren Van Loon, and actor Rudy Valentino were featured in the story, contributing to its rich historical context.", "a-girl-called-samson.epub": "Deborah Samson, a courageous soldier in the American Revolution under the pseudonym Robert Shurtliff, has garnered respect for her military service.

Instead, he encourages thinking about death and the fact that you'll die, from time to time, and cultivating a resilient if not necessarily positive attitude toward it.

The diverse crew included individuals such as Midshipman Isaac Morris, a free Black seaman named John Duck, and carpenter's mate Richard Walter. Richard Walter and Pascoe Thomas' narratives are published, while John Duck's story remains untold. This expedition brings Anson fame, and his men significantly influence the Wager crew Atlas Ocean Voyage's court-martial.\n\nThe Wager, commanded by Captain David Cheap, wrecked on Wager Island due to mutiny, food scarcity, and harsh conditions. The crew's experiences, influenced by the presence of the native Kaw\u00e9sqar people, become entangled with colonialism. Some Kaw\u00e9sqar individuals were abducted, later brought to Chile for proper burial, highlighting the Wager affair's impact on individuals involved.\n\nA key figure in the story is John Byron, a Wager crewmember whose account was published years later, making him a hero. Cheap grappled with leadership amidst mutiny plots and tensions among the castaways. After the shipwreck, Cheap navigated challenges on Wager Island, Kaw\u00e9sqar interactions, and a mutiny that eventually led to his downfall.\n\nThe crew consisted of various members, each with unique perspectives and challenges. Henry Ettrick, Thomas Hamilton, John Harrison, Thomas Harvey, and John King were among those who endured the Wager's journey and the events on Wager Island.\n\nLepore, a modern author researching the Wager expedition, is introduced in the current excerpt. The narrative now includes lice, limes, and Limeys, referring to various aspects of the crew's living conditions and nicknames.\n\nThe castaways found Wager Island's mountainous terrain virtually barren of food. They were forced to consume bits of seaweed and celery. The indigenous people in the region, the Kaw\u00e9sqar, spent much of their time in canoes and survived almost exclusively off marine resources.\n\nA remnant of the Wager wreck was discovered in 2006. The castaways had a copy of John Narborough's account of his British expedition to Patagonia and carefully studied his map of the Strait of Magellan. To escape, the survivors from the Wager would have to navigate through the violent seas along the Chilean coast of Patagonia.\n\nThe story continues to emphasize themes of ambition, power, and colonialism, as well as the human struggle to maintain dignity in adversity. Lepore's research on the Wager expedition focuses on the experiences of the crew members and their interactions with the native Kaw\u00e9sqar people, providing a modern understanding of the historical events and the cultural complexities and implications of colonialism during that time.", "the-wicked-bargain.epub": "The Wicked Bargain, penned by Gabe Cole Novoa, introduces Mar, a transmasculine Latinx pirate with earth-magic, who leads a diverse crew, including Bas, Tito, Dami (a demonio), Vega (ex-captain), Graciela, and Eralia (Graciela's cousin).

    "a-fever-in-the-heartland.epub": "After the Civil War, the original Ku Klux Klan forms in the American South, its masked members using violence and intimidation against newly freed slaves to promote white supremacy. The Klan is structured like a social club with elaborate initiation ceremonies, secretly led by former Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Members adopt white robes and hoods to hide identities while terrorizing and lynching blacks and Republicans.  \n\nYears later, David Stephenson rises as a powerful Klan leader in Indiana, promoting similar nativist, racist and anti-immigrant views. In the 1920s, he presents himself as a white savior, restricts black enrollment at Butler College, and brings Klan support to the Democratic convention, trying to intimidate minorities from voting. Despite this, African American leader George Knox urges blacks to vote against Klan-aligned candidates. \n\nIn 1925, Stephenson begins an affair with married Madge Oberholtzer, providing her an extravagant home where they meet secretly. When Oberholtzer tries ending the affair, Stephenson drugs and assaults her on a train, leading to her death. Lawyer Asa Smith investigates to stop the Klan's control. Although charged, Stephenson seems confident he will avoid prosecution through connections until Oberholtzer's dying declaration detailing his crimes undercuts his status.\n\nAt Stephenson's trial, Oberholtzer's dying declaration evidence turns the public against him as many realize the Klan's true nature from her ordeal. Prosecutor Will Remy and former judge Charles Cox seek to expose the Klan and convict Stephenson, countering attempts to stack the jury. Remy vividly presents witness testimony of Oberholtzer's suffering, swaying the public against Stephenson. Smith's account of taking Oberholtzer's dying declaration also damages Stephenson's case.\n\nAlthough Stephenson tries saving himself through bribery and questionable witnesses painting Oberholtzer as promiscuous, Remy discredits them. Emphasizing Stephenson's boast \"I am the law,\" Remy portrays him as dangerous and above the law. The jury quickly convicts Stephenson of murder, meaning life imprisonment and ending his reign.\n\nAfter conviction, Stephenson appeals but sees himself as a victim. As the Klan's corruption is exposed, its membership declines nationwide, though some in Indiana avoid confronting the Klan's full responsibility in empowering Stephenson. \n\nDaisy Douglas Barr, women's Klan leader in Indiana, works with Stephenson politically. From prison, Stephenson tries pressuring the governor for parole through secrets that could implicate officials. When denied, he provides evidence to prosecutor Will Remy, exposing the full extent of the Klan's corruption and leading to the indictment of Governor Edward Jackson.\n\nIn prison, Stephenson struggles to adjust and control other inmates. He tries to blackmail and extort money from officials to improve his conditions. But warden Russell E. McClain resists Stephenson's demands.\n\nAlthough the Klan declines, racism and violence continue, seen when a white mob brutally lynches two black teenagers, Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith, in 1930 despite lack of evidence. But jazz musician Louis Armstrong defies the Klan's white supremacy by recording pioneering jazz nearby during a Klan gathering.\n\nAfter nearly twenty-five years in prison, Stephenson struggles to adjust on parole before dying in 1966, having outlived some who fought the Klan. Despite the Klan's decline, racism persists, but civil rights leaders emerge, like lynching survivor James Cameron, advocating for equality.",

He delighted in looking through a satirical book called Don'ts for Husbands with his dad Rob. The family took Henry to visit a local school for disabled children, kindling dreams of him someday attending. But soon after, Henry's cancer returned. Knowing further harsh treatments would only diminish his remaining time, Rob and Leah decided against pursuing them. One of Henry's home health aides, Mira, who had grown close to the family, disagreed with their decision and withdrew. \n\nRob and Leah gently informed their young sons Eugene and Oscar that Henry's cancer was back and he would soon die. When the boys asked if this meant Henry would die, Rob somberly confirmed. The parents also notified friends, teachers and acquaintances about Henry's limited prognosis. People reacted in various ways, but a nurse and doctor expressed relief that Henry would be spared additional suffering from more treatments.\n\nThe family had one final Christmas together before Henry passed away. Rob and Leah told Henry that Leah was pregnant again, and Henry was excited to be a big brother. After Henry died at home surrounded by loved ones, Leah gave birth to their fourth son, Teddy. Though Rob was overjoyed with adorable baby Teddy, he broke down when he realized Henry would never get to reunite with them after a trip away.\n\nAs time passes, Rob reflects that his perception of time's speed seems to be accelerating as he gets older. He notes he is now 45 and statistically halfway through life, with his death likely closer than his birth. Rob observes physical changes happening, like no longer being able to sprint without injury.\n\nRob contemplates his own mortality after Henry's death. He wonders if he will wake up when he falls asleep, as the grief has left him exhausted. He considers the possibility of his own heart stopping like Henry's did. When his first son Eugene was born, Rob realized he would someday die, but Henry's death confronted him with the fact his children could die first. Rob thinks about wanting to believe in God just so he can live a long life and then confront God and curse at Him for allowing children to die. Though Rob gets dark comfort from those thoughts, he believes thinking about death and being resilient towards it is wise. Rob is not worried about his own passing for several reasons. He uses the metaphor of a baby being born to illustrate - while people fear the pains of childbirth, the joys of meeting their baby are unimaginable and unknown. Similarly, Rob feels ready to handle dying's difficulties, and is unafraid of death's mystery.",

In 2018 in Sydney, writer Jess Turner learned from her ill grandmother Nora that Jess was raised by Nora after being abandoned by addict mother Polly. Nora mentioned missing pages and selling the Halcyon property after her brother Thomas\u2019s death. Researching online, Jess discovered Thomas was married to murderer Isabel.\n\nJess researched old newspapers, finding Isabel's journal describing inheritance of a cursed teacup before the murders. Nora remained close to the Turners and planned an outing with Isabel to cheer her up after noticing her insomnia and distracted mental state. In 1978, Nora revealed to Polly that Thomas was married to Isabel and inherited the Halcyon house after her suicide. Engaged to American Jonathan James, Polly was urged by Nora not to marry into his prominent political family, fearing the Turner murders would ruin them.\n\nIn 2018, Polly prepared a meal and planned to give Jess a book about the Turners, hoping it would provide answers about their family history that Nora kept secret. Townspeople became anxious after the suicide and began turning against Isabel, criticizing her unusual behavior. Investigator Sergeant Peter Duke was unable to find any close friends Isabel confided in about marital problems. A psychiatric report indicated Isabel may have suffered from postpartum psychosis.\n\nIn December 2018, Meg Summers revealed she had found the Turners' missing baby alive and hidden her in their coach house. Percy considered the implications of returning the baby versus keeping her hidden, worried the police investigation would turn to his family if they admitted Meg took the baby without reporting it.\n\nIn December 2018, Nora's cassette tape revealed that on the night of the Turner tragedy, Nora gave birth to Polly amidst a violent storm while alone at the Halcyon house. She later realized the officers mistook Polly for Isabel's missing baby Thea. She decided to raise Thea as her own daughter Polly, keeping her true identity secret.\n\nIn December 2018 at the Halcyon cove, Jess found Polly coming to terms with learning she was really Thea Turner. Polly had once before gone to Tambilla unbeknownst to Jess, planning to tell her the truth about their family history and Nora's secrets.

Despite this, Jess investigated the attic and found the case that belonged to Isabel. Inside were sentimental keepsakes and Isabel's journal, which contained torn out pages that Jess found tucked inside. The pages described Isabel's plan to take her children back to England, suggesting the family's deaths may have been an accident, not a murder-suicide.\n\nIn December 2018, Polly found a letter hidden in Isabel's journal indicating someone else knew of Isabel's affair and threatened to expose it.

In ancient Rome, plagues weakened armies and fractured the empire. In 14th century Europe, the Black Death pandemic spread from Asia and decimated populations, contributing to feudalism\u2019s decline as peasants resisted their lords.\n\nIn 1519, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s conquered the Aztec Empire in Mexico with few men, aided by diseases devastating the natives. Centuries before, Norse colonization of North America\u2019s Vinland failed due to native conflicts, while later English colonization succeeded after European diseases decimated natives. In West Africa, African diseases prevented Portuguese colonization inland until quinine enabled exploration. \n\nIn late 19th century Congo, Belgium\u2019s King Leopold II brutally exploited the Congolese for profit. In the Caribbean, Columbus\u2019 diseases and sugarcane plantations decimated indigenous populations, leading to replacement by more disease-resistant Africans from the slave trade, which also brought pathogens.\n\nIn 18th century Haiti, slavery supported plantations, but brutal treatment necessitated continuous slave importation from Africa until slaves revolted in 1791, gaining advantage from disease immunity. In 1804 they established independent Haiti after defeating France.\n\nIn 19th century Britain, the Industrial Revolution shifted the economy from rural agriculture to urban industry, causing overcrowding and disease in cities, disrupting landowners' power and benefiting industrialists. Despite piecemeal solutions, poor sanitation caused recurrent cholera outbreaks until major sanitation projects increased life expectancy. However, Hamburg resisted improving sanitation until an 1892 cholera outbreak.\n\nIn the early 1600s, the Pilgrims considered settling in Essequibo but chose New England instead due to its more temperate climate being better suited for English settlers compared to hotter regions like Essequibo with more diseases. \n\nIn late 19th century Vienna, anti-semitism and racism rose as the multinational Austro-Hungarian Empire declined. This contributed to psychoanalysis' development as Sigmund Freud treated wealthy Viennese women. Meanwhile, working-class overcrowding, poverty and infectious diseases persisted in the city.\n\nSince 2010, austerity policies have exacerbated health inequalities in Britain. The US also has stark disparities, with declining life expectancy driven by rising deaths of despair among disadvantaged populations failed by privatized healthcare. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic highlighted global health inequalities as poorer nations lacked vaccine access. Diseases still disproportionately impact vulnerable populations despite medical advances. \n\nIn China, public health efforts under Mao Zedong in the 1950s-60s greatly reduced infectious diseases through vaccines, sanitation, and barefoot doctors, but were later disrupted. After Mao's death, economic reforms, universal health coverage, and renewed disease control improved public health and reduced infectious diseases since the 1980s, showing the power yet fragility of public health efforts.\n\nThe bubonic plague emerged in Asia and spread via trade routes to Europe, Africa and the Americas over centuries. Rats, fleas, and human mobility enabled its spread. Quarantines aimed to contain it, but public health weaknesses caused recurrent outbreaks until living standards improved.\n\nIn ancient Greece, the Delian League united Greek city-states against Persia. Later, the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta weakened Greece, enabling Macedon's conquest under Alexander the Great, whose empire spread Greek culture across the Mediterranean and Middle East. The Byzantines preserved Greek and Roman heritage until the 1453 fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans.",

Despite meager gains raiding Spanish colonies, he remained determined to circumnavigate the globe. After repairs in Canton, Anson deceived the Spanish by feigning return home while secretly waiting to ambush their annual treasure galleon near the Philippines. In June 1743, Anson spotted the galleon Covadonga carrying Spain\u2019s plundered year of treasure worth $80 million today. Though outgunned, Covadonga\u2019s captain Montero boldly sailed toward Centurion to defend the treasure. Given his depleted crew, Anson used unconventional tactics to trap and paralyze Covadonga with sharpshooters picking off its crew. Anson emerged victorious, promoting humane treatment of prisoners while seizing the Navy\u2019s largest treasure ever.\n\nIn 1746, the improbable survival of Wager deserters Cheap, Hamilton, and Byron meant Cheap could challenge Bulkeley\u2019s mutiny accusations at a court-martial and defend his reputation.

Mar realizes their magic is finally free and under control.\n\nThe fictional pirates are loosely based on real Latin American pirates like Roberto Cofres\u00ed and Diabolito. The author avoided using real pirates due to concerns about whitewashing slave ownership. The story is set in 1820 as countries were fighting for independence from Spain.

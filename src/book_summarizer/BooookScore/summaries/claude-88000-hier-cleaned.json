    "a-fever-in-the-heartland.epub": "In the mid-1920s, the Ku Klux Klan underwent a resurgence in power and membership under the ruthless leadership of D.C. Stephenson, a con man who exploited people's prejudices to amass wealth and control for himself. Stephenson established a chapter of the Klan in Indiana and quickly grew its ranks to over 250,000 by allying with fearful white Protestant ministers. These ministers spread the Klan's hateful message targeting Catholics, Jews, immigrants and African Americans from their pulpits. \n\nStephenson appointed Klansmen to law enforcement and political positions across Indiana, allowing the Klan to operate above the law. But in 1925, his horrific crimes against a young white schoolteacher named Madge Oberholtzer led to his downfall and the Klan's grip on power being broken.\n\nOberholtzer was kidnapped, raped and murdered by Stephenson. Before dying, she managed to provide a graphic declaration detailing how Stephenson had bitten, beaten and mutilated her. This led to Stephenson's arrest along with two henchmen.\n\nThe prosecutor, 33-year-old Will Remy, refused to join the Klan or appoint Klansmen as deputies despite intense pressure from Stephenson. Remy received constant death threats and police protection, as the Indianapolis police department was under Klan influence. He was determined to bring Stephenson to justice, though the effort wore down the already thin and frail-looking Remy.\n\nStephenson hired experienced lawyers and enjoyed special treatment in jail, where he lived comfortably and gained weight while awaiting trial. He remained confident of acquittal, believing locals were still on his side. \n\nThe trial was delayed and moved to Noblesville where the Klan's support was strong. The jury pool was filled with Klansmen, part of a justice system influenced by the hate group. But Remy tirelessly built his case.\n\nAt the trial, Oberholtzer's dying declaration was read before the all-white male jury, providing graphic details of Stephenson's crimes against her. The jury convicted Stephenson of second-degree murder, sentencing him to life in prison. His two associates were acquitted. \n\nThough Stephenson tried bringing down the Klan with him through blackmail, his conviction was a major blow to the organization nationally. Membership plummeted as investigations exposed rampant corruption between Klan leaders and officials. The Klan lost its grip on power in Indiana, though its legacy of violence against minorities continued for decades.\n\nOberholtzer's refusal to stay silent, even in death, along with Remy's determination to pursue justice despite threats and intimidation, led to the downfall of a terrorist group that had gained control of a major American state.

Henry was Delaney's third son, born in London shortly after Delaney moved there for a TV show. When Henry was 11 months old, he began frequently vomiting, leading Delaney and his wife Leah to take him to various doctors. An MRI revealed a large tumor in Henry's brain stem, requiring emergency surgery at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital to relieve pressure and remove what they could. The surgery left Henry paralyzed on one side of his face and unable to swallow, so he needed a tracheostomy tube to breathe. Henry spent months in the pediatric ICU and cancer wards, undergoing chemotherapy and struggling through infections and procedures. Delaney painfully watched his disabled son work hard at physical therapy and bond with nurses. \n\nAfter 14 months in the hospital, Henry was finally able to move home. Delaney poignantly describes the family's joy at being together again and Henry happily playing with his older brothers despite limitations.

One morning when Henry was two and a half years old, he died peacefully in his mother's arms.

Latika hides the letter from Arun and reads it alone, discovering it is an order from Amin to immediately stop publishing their underground newspaper Jicho, which has been printing anti-government articles. Latika has secretly kept the paper going against Arun's wishes, as he argues it endangers their family while she believes justice is more important than their personal safety.  \n\nLatika hides the letter out of fear of Arun's reaction and thrill at the power it places in her hands, as the soldier assumed Arun was in charge, not realizing she runs Jicho.

Haunted by their helplessness when the German soldier tried to kill them, Dorothy began giving Irene shooting lessons at the hotel, while also striking up an unlikely friendship with Garcia, who understood her trauma. But soon they had to return to the road near the frontlines in their Clubmobile.\n\nOne night while driving in the mountains, Irene crashed their Clubmobile and it exploded. Believing Dorothy had perished in the blast, a devastated Irene retreated to the old Woodward family farm where she lived reclusively for decades, harboring immense guilt over her friend's supposed death. But one day, Irene received a visitor - a young girl named Dolly who was searching for the Woodward farm. Dolly recognized a portrait of Dorothy hanging in Irene's home and revealed that Dorothy was her still-living grandmother. \n\nStunned, Irene realized Dolly's grandmother was her long-lost friend Dorothy, who Irene had thought died that night 50 years ago. After Irene retreated into her house, an emotional reunion took place when Dorothy emerged from Dolly's motorhome parked outside, along with Dolly's mother Andrea, who was the baby Dorothy had rescued from a boxcar and smuggled to safety during the war - unbeknownst to Irene at the time. Dorothy explained that she had actually survived the Clubmobile crash and went on to raise rescued baby Andrea as her own daughter. \n\nWith their decades-long estrangement based on mistaken assumptions now reconciled, Irene welcomed her old friend Dorothy and her family into the Woodward farmhouse they had once dreamed of visiting together. After 50 years apart harboring immense guilt, Irene was overjoyed to catch up and renew her friendship with Dorothy, who she never expected to see again. Their emotional reunion marked the beginning of a new chapter at the farmhouse, as the two women revived their kinship and finally shared the story of what happened on that pivotal night long ago when their paths fatefully diverged.",

The next day, Yunxian meets Lady Liu and Widow Bao, wives of Beijing officials visiting her household. Their discussion of procuring eunuchs for the Emperor's palace shocks the women, highlighting class divides. Widow Bao expresses interest in meeting Yunxian, the doctor Maoren boasted of, sparking tension with Yunxian's disapproving mother-in-law.  \n\nIn a later excerpt, Yunxian is summoned by the Empress in Beijing to treat her eye infection. Her friend Meiling, a midwife, is there to deliver the Empress's baby. After the birth, Meiling is brutally beaten for bleeding during the delivery, polluting the Empress's sight. Back home, a smallpox epidemic kills Yunxian's daughter Ailan. Yunxian tirelessly treats the ill until the disease passes. Soon after, she gives birth to a long-awaited son, Lian. \n\nMeiling confesses she aborted Yunxian's earlier pregnancy out of jealousy. Yunxian investigates, discovering the household doctor Wong secretly fathered the concubine's child, hoping to make him heir. Wong murdered Yunxian's aunt for uncovering his plot and gave Yunxian abortifacients disguised as pregnancy medicines.

She becomes famous for her remedies and continues practicing into old age. \n\nThe excerpt from the book's front matter establishes it as a fictionalized memoir recounting a female doctor's experiences through four metaphorical life stages, from girlish innocence to mature wisdom. Though presented as rediscovered records, the memoir format implies it chronicles the pioneering physician's challenges and achievements in pursuing her vocation during eras restrictive for women.\n\nOverall, Yunxian's intelligence and medical skills seem at odds with patriarchal limitations, as she defies convention to become an acclaimed doctor. The story highlights Yunxian's conflicts with gender barriers and quest to record her knowledge while rooted in rich historical detail of class divides, medical practices, and women's restricted roles in 16th century Chinese society.",

    "pathogenesis-a-history-of-the-world-in-eight-plagues.epub": "Prior to industrialization, Great Britain was predominantly rural with most people working in agriculture. The 18th century saw rapid urbanization and economic growth due to inventions like the steam engine and the rise of the textile industry. While industrialization led to remarkable economic expansion, it initially came at a cost for the urban working classes who suffered from overcrowding, lack of sanitation, and infectious diseases in cities. Life expectancy stagnated and was even lower in industrial cities than rural areas. People flooded into dirty, crowded cities to find work. Factories employed even young children for long hours in dangerous conditions. Without proper sewage systems, wastes piled up, contaminating water and spreading diseases like tuberculosis. Cholera emerged as one of the deadliest diseases, killing half its victims in days due to severe dehydration. It disproportionately affected the urban poor without clean water access. Doctors could not effectively treat it, and their quarantine measures led to distrust and riots among the lower classes against officials believed to be using disease to poison the poor. Overcrowded slums enabled diseases to spread rapidly. Still, the government did little to address public health issues in the early 19th century. Life expectancy only began improving later in the century with advances in sanitation, hygiene, nutrition and medicine. \n\nMore broadly, the adoption of agriculture 10,000 years ago enabled population growth but also spread diseases more easily. Contact with livestock brought about diseases like tuberculosis jumping from animals to humans. Growing trade networks further spread pathogens, evidenced by a Neolithic plague in Eastern Europe around 5,000 years ago. Later, the 14th century Black Death in Central Asia spread via trade routes and killed about half of Europe's population. This massive die-off transformed European economies and societies, with labor becoming more scarce and empowered after the plague. The Catholic Church was weakened and criticisms emerged from reformers like Jan Hus. Social mobility increased, helping drive the Renaissance. \n\nWhen Europeans later conquered the Americas, the natives' lack of immunity to Old World diseases like smallpox enabled conquest by the Spanish despite having few soldiers. West Africans had higher malaria and yellow fever resistance than Europeans, aiding the Atlantic slave trade. European colonialism in Africa was facilitated by quinine from South America to help them survive.\n\nOverall, infectious diseases have profoundly shaped human history, interconnected with major transformations like agriculture, colonialism, and industrialization. Pathogens have impacted societies as much as socioeconomic changes. In 19th century Britain, industrialization\u2019s urban crowding and lack of sanitation caused disease outbreaks until public health reforms emerged. Similarly, adoption of agriculture enabled disease spread, while European conquest in the Americas was aided by natives' lack of immunity. Major disease outbreaks like the Black Death have transformed societies. Thus infectious diseases and immunity factors have been deeply intertwined with economic and social changes throughout human history.",

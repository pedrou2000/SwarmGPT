    "while-time-remains.epub": "\"While Time Remains\" is a memoir by Yeonmi Park, a North Korean defector born in 1993 who escaped the brutal regime, experienced sex slavery in China, found freedom in South Korea, and eventually immigrated to America in 2015. Growing up in Hyesan, North Korea, Yeonmi witnessed the catastrophic famine that claimed millions of lives and was subjected to indoctrination and anti-American propaganda in her education. After her father was imprisoned for smuggling, Yeonmi and her mother followed her sister Eunmi to China, only to be sold as human trafficking victims. Despite their harrowing experiences, they managed to navigate their journey to South Korea with the help of Christian missionaries.\n\nIn South Korea, Yeonmi pursued higher education, studying law and English, and became increasingly committed to the cause of human rights for North Koreans. Her emotional speech at the One Young World summit in Ireland went viral, leading her to address the United Nations Human Rights Council, where she faced harassment from North Korean officials. Yeonmi eventually moved to New York City to study economics at Columbia University, where she encountered stifling ideologues in the American education system. Throughout her journey, Yeonmi shares her experiences navigating cultural differences, from food and fitness to beauty standards, and encounters with race in America.\n\nUpon arriving in America, Yeonmi becomes disillusioned with the insincerity and superficiality of American elites, as well as their reluctance to confront the Chinese Communist Party's role in the ongoing human rights crisis in North Korea. She continues to deliver speeches about her experiences, encountering silence and lack of action from prominent individuals she meets at events like Campfire and the Met Gala. The memoir also discusses the surge of physical attacks on Asian Americans, the rise of cancel culture, and the importance of capitalism and meritocracy in achieving national prosperity.\n\nYeonmi shares her personal experiences with cancel culture, such as YouTube demonetizing her videos and social media platforms shadow-banning her accounts. She also recounts being invited to speak at Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., only to have the speech canceled because it was deemed \"too political.\" The story highlights the dangers of cancel culture and censorship in America, as they undermine the fundamental rights of free speech and expression. Yeonmi warns that such actions can lead to a society where people are unable to criticize or oppose oppressive policies and practices.\n\nThroughout the memoir, Yeonmi draws parallels between the political climate in the United States and North Korea, emphasizing the importance of standing up to oppressive regimes like North Korea and China to prevent the spread of their influence and the suffering they inflict on innocent people. She also shares her admiration for Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Candace Owens, and Ben Shapiro, influential figures who have had an impact on her life.\n\nThe memoir concludes with Yeonmi's move to Chicago, where she continues her activism and education endeavors while raising her son and living with her husband. Despite personal challenges, including her divorce, she remains committed to instilling values in her son and advocating for human rights. \"While Time Remains\" serves as a dire warning against embracing ideologies that lead to the suffering of millions and emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and intellectual freedom.

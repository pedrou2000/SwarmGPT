The narrative is set in Georgetown and Washington D.C., with June living in New York.\n\nJune and Athena maintain a tenuous friendship, but June can't help but feel that Athena's star power is due to her attractive and exotic persona rather than her writing abilities. She reflects on the publishing industry's tendency to anoint a chosen few and wonders if she will ever be able to achieve the same level of success, despite her talent and hard work.\n\nThe story takes an ominous turn when June finds herself on a rooftop with Athena, who starts choking on a pancake. Despite June's attempts to save her, Athena dies, leaving June in shock and guilt.

She sends the manuscript to Brett, her literary agent, who helps her get it published. However, the success of the novel brings up ethical dilemmas for June, and she finds herself torn between her loyalty to Athena and her own ambition.\n\nJune's internal struggle is further complicated when she finds out that Athena's mother is planning to donate Athena's drafting notebooks to the Marlin Archive.

{"reminiscences-of-pioneer-days-in-st-paul": {"summaries_dict": {"0": ["The story recounts the evolution and struggles of the early newspaper industry in St. Paul, Minnesota, particularly through the experiences of the Pioneer and the Minnesotian newspapers. James M. Goodhue, an early newspaper figure, would be astounded by the technological advancements such as the web-perfecting press and linotype machines that revolutionized newspaper production by the latter half of the 19th century. In 1857, Minnesota's election for delegates to its constitutional convention led to a division between Republicans and Democrats, resulting in separate conventions and subsequent printing contracts awarded to the Pioneer and the Minnesotian. This period saw significant financial strain and legal battles, notably when the Minnesotian faced an injunction that delayed payments for their printing work until courts ruled in their favor.\n\nIn 1858, the laying of the first Atlantic cable was eagerly anticipated, with local newspapers relying on steamboats like the Gray Eagle and Itasca for the latest news. The Minnesotian managed to scoop its competitors by quickly publishing the Queen's message. During the summer, newspapers depended heavily on steamboats for telegraph news from Dubuque and Chicago, leading to competitive scrambles among messengers at the levee.\n\nThe Minnesotian also pioneered local feature illustrations in 1859, using creative but limited resources to depict a lynching incident in Wright County. That year was politically significant as Alexander Ramsey and George L. Becker contested the gubernatorial election. The Republicans, aiming to secure both the governorship and a U.S. Senate seat, brought in notable speakers like Galusha A. Grow and Schuyler Colfax, but a fire during a speech by Colfax highlighted the limitations of the era's news coverage.\n\nThe period between the 1857 panic and the Civil War was challenging for printers, with low wages and scarce money. A memorable incident involved a Minnesotian proprietor's failed attempt to scoop the president's message by intercepting the mail coach, only to return and find the message already published.\n\nIn 1860, the completion of the first telegraph line to St. Paul promised better news access, but high costs led to a temporary boycott by local papers. The Pioneer secretly resumed telegraph services, leading to a humorous episode where it tricked the Minnesotian into publishing bogus news, underscoring the intense competition and ingenuity of the period's newspaper industry.", "The excerpt recounts significant historical events and personal anecdotes related to the early days of journalism and pivotal moments in Minnesota's history, particularly during the Civil War era. It begins with the establishment of the Press newspaper in January 1861, which faced initial challenges in securing telegraphic dispatches but eventually overcame them after a tense encounter between Governor Marshall and Mr. Winslow.\n\nGovernor Marshall is depicted as a noble and patriotic figure, deeply moved by the Union's struggles during the Civil War, particularly after the Battle of Bull Run. The narrative then highlights the patriotic fervor among printers when President Lincoln called for more troops in 1862, leading to staff shortages at the Press. Volunteers, including an elderly Mr. Metcalf, stepped in to help despite their inexperience.\n\nThe story shifts to the anti-draft sentiment in some Minnesota counties with significant foreign populations. A draft riot was feared, prompting the Press to organize a defense led by Capt. E.R. Otis, a former soldier. Although tensions were high, the draft proceeded without incident.\n\nThe narrative also touches on the practices of daily newspapers during holidays and recounts a significant moment on July 4, 1863, when the Press had exclusive coverage of the Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg due to the Pioneer's relocation efforts.\n\nThe author's personal journey in journalism begins in April 1858, working for the Daily Minnesotian. He quickly learns the importance of timely news reporting, particularly during the admission of Minnesota into the Union, which the Pioneer managed to scoop from other papers.\n\nTechnological advancements in newspaper printing are noted, from single-cylinder presses to linotype machines, reflecting the industry's evolution. The Five Million Loan Election, a significant political event, is detailed, highlighting the intense public interest and the eventual fallout when the state's bonds could not be negotiated, leading to financial repercussions.\n\nThe excerpt concludes with a vivid account of a battle between the Sioux and Chippewas near Shakopee in May 1858, showcasing the ongoing conflict between these tribes. The narrative captures the essence of a young state grappling with war, technological progress, and political upheaval, all through the lens of a burgeoning newspaper industry and its dedicated individuals.", "The story recounts a series of significant events in St. Paul, starting with the grand celebration on September 1, 1858, marking the successful laying of the Atlantic cable. This event saw an elaborate procession involving various groups such as the Pioneer Guard, City Guard, and numerous civic and social organizations. The celebration was a major event, drawing thousands of spectators and featuring floats, including a notable contribution from the Pioneer Printing Company, which depicted historical figures and scenes. Despite the festivities, a storm postponed the planned fireworks.\n\nCoincidentally, the celebration day marked the last message exchanged via the cable, which had been operational for about four weeks. The cable's successful operation involved multiple attempts from 1857 to 1865, with Cyrus W. Field playing a pivotal role, earning recognition from Congress and offers of knighthood from Great Britain.\n\nThe narrative then shifts to the formation of the Sons of Malta, a secret order established in the early 1850s, which quickly gained popularity in St. Paul. The initiation process was notably intense, involving public confessions and various pranks. A significant event for the order was a visit from members of the order from other cities, culminating in a grand banquet and a barbecue at Minnehaha Falls. However, the order's popularity waned after Rev. John Penman exposed its secrets in Harper's Weekly, leading to its decline.\n\nThe story also delves into the rivalry between two Republican newspapers, the Minnesotian and the Times, during the 1859 state printer campaign. Despite both papers' contributions to the Republican cause, their editors, Dr. Foster and Maj. Newson, engaged in a bitter feud. The conflict was temporarily resolved by merging the papers into the Minnesotian and Times, but the partnership soon dissolved, leading to the eventual dominance of the St. Paul Daily Press.\n\nAdditionally, the narrative mentions the short-lived Daily North Star, a Breckinridge Democrat paper during the 1860 presidential campaign, and the St. Paul Weekly Journal, which opposed the Civil War and had a brief existence in 1862.\n\nFinally, the story touches on the Great Sioux Outbreak in 1862, a period of significant turmoil and conflict, highlighting the broader context of national strife during the Civil War.", "During the tumultuous period of the American Civil War in 1862, the U.S. government faced numerous challenges, including a precarious situation in Minnesota. The Sioux Indians, discontented with the terms of treaties that had forced them to sell their lands and relocate, were suffering from delays in annuity payments due to the war. This unrest culminated in a violent outbreak led by Little Crow, exacerbated by internal divisions among the Sioux between those who adopted farming and those who resisted abandoning traditional ways. \n\nThe Sioux, feeling betrayed and desperate, initiated a brutal attack on the white settlers, starting with an ambush at Action, Meeker County, and rapidly escalating into widespread massacres. Capt. Marsh and his detachment from Company B of the Fifth Regiment were ambushed, resulting in significant casualties. The violence spread across the Sioux reservation, leading to the deaths of around 1,000 people and the displacement of 30,000 settlers within a week. The atrocities committed during this period were severe, including the massacre of entire families and the destruction of property.\n\nMinnesota's Governor Ramsey urgently mobilized the state legislature to address the crisis, emphasizing the horrific nature of the Indian attacks. Amidst the chaos, a Dakota Indian named Other Day emerged as a hero by leading 62 men, women, and children to safety, demonstrating that not all Native Americans supported the violence.\n\nEx-Governor Sibley was appointed to lead the military response, assembling poorly armed and hastily organized troops to counter the Sioux. The besieged Fort Ridgely, commanded by Lieut. T.J. Sheehan, held out against a large Sioux force until relieved by Col. McPhail's volunteers. Concurrently, Judge Charles E. Flandrau organized a volunteer force to defend New Ulm, successfully repelling the Sioux but ultimately evacuating the town due to resource shortages.\n\nSibley's arrival at Fort Ridgely marked a turning point. He dispatched a detail under Maj. Joseph R. Brown to bury the dead and rescue survivors. However, Brown\u2019s command was ambushed at Birch Coulie, suffering heavy casualties before being rescued. This series of events underscored the desperate and chaotic nature of the conflict, highlighting both the brutal realities of frontier warfare and the resilience of those defending their homes.", "In the aftermath of a disastrous attack by Sioux warriors, St. Paul, Minnesota, was gripped by fear and chaos. The city quickly organized home guards and nightly patrols, though they lacked adequate arms. Governor Ramsey tried to calm the populace, assuring them that the nearest threats were miles away. Despite this, rumors and reports of further outrages spread, causing widespread panic and an influx of refugees.\n\nAs the situation escalated, General Sibley amassed a force of 2,000 men, including the Third Regiment and a battery led by Captain Mark Hendricks. They encountered Sioux warriors near Wood Lake on September 23, leading to a decisive battle where Colonel Marshall's charge routed the enemy. This victory marked the end of major hostilities, and General Pope declared the war over. However, the people of Minnesota insisted on keeping the troops until further sweeps through the Dakotas and Montana.\n\nSibley's forces reached Camp Release on September 26, where they liberated 250 captives held by the Sioux. A military tribunal subsequently sentenced 303 Sioux to death, though President Lincoln commuted most sentences, allowing only 38 executions. These executions, carried out on December 26, 1862, were met with mixed reactions, including protests from Eastern states.\n\nThe military faced logistical challenges, notably the transportation of supplies to frontier troops, leading to the impressment of civilian teams and horses. Notably, even Governor Ramsey's carriage team was requisitioned. The Ladies Aid Society of St. Paul, led by Mrs. Stella Selby and Miss M.O. Holyoke, played a crucial role in supporting soldiers and refugees, providing essential supplies and comfort.\n\nThe Sioux forfeited significant land and annuities due to the uprising, losing 750,000 acres valued at millions. This land could have made them one of the wealthiest communities per capita in the U.S. if they had maintained peace.\n\nThe narrative also touches on the early history of St. Paul's fire department, highlighting the bravery and camaraderie of its members. These pioneers, who faced numerous hotel fires and other emergencies, are remembered fondly for their courage and dedication.\n\nIn summary, the excerpt chronicles a period of intense conflict and community response in Minnesota, detailing the military actions, civilian efforts, and the broader implications of the Sioux uprising. The story captures the resilience and resourcefulness of both the military and civilian populations during a tumultuous time.", "The story delves into the history of fire-fighting practices and the evolution of fire departments, particularly in the United States and Europe. It begins with a nostalgic reflection on the early days of fire-fighting, highlighting the primitive equipment used over three centuries ago, such as large water tanks on wheels and bucket brigades. The narrative then transitions to the advancements made in fire-fighting technology, including the introduction of leather hoses in Amsterdam in 1670 and the development of improved fire engines in England by the late seventeenth century.\n\nIn the early 19th century, American cities began organizing bucket fire departments, with New York's volunteer fire department becoming a notable institution. The New York volunteer firemen's annual parades were significant events, drawing large crowds and sometimes resulting in melees over competition results. The story also touches on the relaxed and somewhat ineffective fire-fighting practices in Berlin, where firemen would often arrive at the scene after the fire had been extinguished.\n\nCincinnati is credited with introducing the first paid steam fire department in the United States, a model quickly adopted by other large cities. In St. Paul, the town fathers passed an ordinance in 1850 requiring building owners to maintain fire buckets, leading to the formation of the first fire brigade by R.C. Knox in 1851. Knox, a man of enormous stature, was known for his tireless efforts during fires.\n\nJohn McCloud and Thompson Ritchie, two public-spirited citizens, brought the first fire engine to St. Paul at their own expense. In 1854, the Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 was organized, with members excused from various civic duties as compensation for their services. John McCloud, instrumental in forming this company, is remembered as the \"Father of the Volunteer Fire Department of St. Paul.\"\n\nThe story continues with the formation of other fire companies, such as Hope Engine Company No. 1 in 1857 and Minnehaha Engine Company No. 2 in 1857-1858. These companies played crucial roles in protecting the city, with their annual parades becoming significant events.

Borup, was destroyed by fire while being prepared for opening by Howard Ward and E.C. Rich. Similarly, the Rice House, the first brick building in St. Paul, constructed by Henry M. Rice, burned down in 1856. This three-story hotel, located on Third Street near Market, had hosted the second session of the territorial legislature and the supreme court of the territory.\n\nThe Canada House and Galena House, small frame structures on Robert near Third, were well-patronized hotels that also succumbed to fire. On March 16, 1860, St. Paul experienced its most destructive fire, which started on Third Street near Jackson. The fire destroyed thirty-four buildings, including the New England hotel, the first gubernatorial mansion, and the Empire Saloon, where the first printing office of the territory was located.\n\nIn 1862, the Winslow House, a four-story brick hotel built by J.M. Winslow at Seven Corners, was destroyed due to a defective stovepipe. The proprietors were accused of arson but were later discharged.

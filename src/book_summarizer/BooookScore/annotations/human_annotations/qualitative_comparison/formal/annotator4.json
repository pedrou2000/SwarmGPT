Josie works at Fort Bliss, a military base in Texas, where she is responsible for conducting intake briefings for former Nazi scientists brought to the United States under Operation Paperclip, a secret government program. Arlette, engaged to Luc Minau, lives in Paris and works at a café. They reunite in French Guiana to confront their wartime experiences and seek justice for the atrocities committed during the war.\n\nArlette is on a mission to find her long-lost son Willie, who was taken from her during the war. She believes he might be at a camp in French Guiana run by Luc called Hope Home. Josie is on a quest to capture a dangerous Nazi doctor named Snow, who is connected to their shared past and responsible for the death of her mother. They suspect Father Peter, a camp priest, to be involved in nefarious activities, including forcible insemination, the development of a germ bomb, and possibly being Dr. Snow.\n\nDuring World War II, Josie and Arlette had worked together as the \"Golden Doves,\" intercepting German conversations and passing the information to their superiors in London. They were successful in stopping Heinrich Himmler from visiting Paris by alerting the French people to his planned visit. Despite their dangerous work, Josie and Arlette bonded over their shared experiences and the challenges of motherhood.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Arlette and Josie grapple with their past experiences, the ongoing search for Dr. Snow, and the challenges they face in their quest for justice. Arlette is determined to stay focused on her mission to find her son, despite the distractions and challenges she faces in French Guiana.

She spends time with him at the boys' camp, where she suspects Father Peter to be involved in some nefarious activities. Josie visits the girls' camp and discovers young women and babies with numbers tattooed on their wrists. The two friends work together to expose the sinister plot involving forcible insemination and the development of a germ bomb possibly being conducted by Father Peter, who is likely Dr. Snow.\n\nTeaming up with a local doctor named Bondi, who has been studying the mysterious virus affecting the camp's children, Arlette and Josie learn of the virus's connection to the experiments conducted by Father Peter and another man named Gregor Ebner. They break into a radio hut to contact Josie's friend Karl, who works for the U.S. Army, for backup.\n\nFather Peter catches Arlette in the radio hut, and she is taken at gunpoint back to Cove House, where Luc confronts her about her involvement. As tensions rise, Arlette is desperate to find her son and bring those responsible for the atrocities at the camp to justice. Father Peter insists that Arlette be sent home alone without her son Thomas, while Josie worries about her own safety and the possible betrayal of her connections.\n\nThe women's pursuit of justice continues as they navigate the dangers and complications of their situation, torn between their love for their families, their loyalty to one another, and their desire for truth and closure. As they face powerful enemies, their shared past as the \"Golden Doves\" proves to be a crucial link in their efforts to expose the dark secrets and evil deeds of those they once fought against in the war.\n\nWhen Arlette sneaks into Danae's office to find the blood-test results to confirm Thomas as her son, she finds the results inconclusive. Meanwhile, Josie discovers more about the Hope Home ambassadors, a group of children involved in a secret project with Luc and Danae. In a confrontation at the helipad, Josie and Bondi face Luc and Danae, as Arlette wonders if she can trust Josie to protect her and her son, Thomas.\n\nDanae, who is revealed to be Dr. Snow, offers Josie information about Willie in exchange for help escaping to America. When Danae meets her end, Josie reclaims The Le Joyeux Oiseau Café in Paris, where she raises Thomas as her son.

Her husband, Matthew, is a successful businessman who is often distant and dismissive of her feelings. Alejandra's emotional turmoil is deepened by her strained relationship with her husband, feelings of isolation and worthlessness, and her recent reconnection with her birth mother, Cathy.\n\nThe story delves into Alejandra's past, including her difficult childhood, her adoptive father's harsh words, and her adoptive sibling Charlie who provided some comfort during those times. As Alejandra's mental state continues to deteriorate, she experiences strange occurrences, vivid nightmares, and encounters with a mysterious figure in white, which she initially believes to be La Llorona, a Mexican folklore figure.\n\nAlejandra seeks help from Melanie, a therapist and curandera, who suggests that the women in her visions might be related to the story of La Llorona and Alejandra's own feelings of despair and hopelessness. As Alejandra grapples with her past and her identity, she becomes determined to provide a better life for her children and to help them find their own paths. She wants Catrina to have the opportunity to pursue her interests and passions, something Alejandra feels she was never able to do herself. As she grapples with her own identity and heritage, Alejandra hopes that she can find a way to break free from the constraints of her life and reclaim her sense of self.\n\nIn the midst of her turmoil, Alejandra discovers the connections between her family's past and the story of Flor, a soldadera (female soldier) from the Mexican Revolution, who falls in love with Emiliano, a fellow fighter. Tragically, Emiliano is killed, and Flor is wounded and loses their unborn child. Suffering from her own personal losses, Flor returns to her family, seeking to rebuild her life, and promises her daughter Regina that they will change the future and sever the cord of generational curses.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Alejandra and the women from her dreams, including her ancestor Atzi, are connected across time and space, both struggling with the burdens of motherhood and the weight of their respective histories. The women may hold the key to unlocking the power and strength that both need to overcome their challenges and find a way to heal. Alejandra, Cathy, and Melanie must confront their fears and draw on the strength of their family's past to protect their loved ones and break the generational curse that has haunted them for so long.\n\nDetermined to protect her family and break the curse, Alejandra devises a plan to trick the creature by attempting to take her own life, believing that this will allow her to gain the power she needs to destroy it. Despite her fears, Cathy agrees to support her daughter in this fight. Together with Melanie, they discuss their experiences with the creature and try to make sense of the plan to defeat it. Melanie believes that the connections between their family members and their shared past could be the key to overcoming the curse.\n\nAs they prepare to face the creature, Alejandra, Cathy, and Melanie must confront their fears and draw on the strength of their family's past to protect their loved ones and break the generational curse that has haunted them for so long. Alejandra performs a ritual with her children's blood, calling upon the spirits of her ancestors to help her in her battle.\n\nAs the demon appears to Alejandra, she confronts it by realizing its own curse of never experiencing the true beauty of existence. In a desperate act, Alejandra stabs herself in the belly, offering the demon her seeds, but her ancestors help her fight back. She recovers from her injuries in the hospital, and later reflects on her life and desires for the future.\n\nReturning home, Alejandra is greeted by her children, and she confirms to Catrina that she killed the demon and it will never bother them again. She also encourages Catrina to be strong and confident. Alejandra's experience has changed her outlook on life, and she now wants to focus on healing and growing into her new way of being.

As the girls live a good life with Adana, the legend of La Llorona is born from the gossip of their mother's death in their village, representing the pain and struggle that the women in Alejandra's family have faced for generations.\n\nAlejandra's journey to confront her past and protect her children serves as a testament to the power of family, love, and healing as she seeks to break the cycle of pain and curses, culminating in her determination to become a source of healing for herself and others."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:49:28.478644Z","updated_at":"2023-09-22T15:37:04.844391Z","inner_id":5,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":59,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6657,"annotations":[{"id":2331,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Draw"]},"id":"DI3Z13yxE-","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Draw.

The story revolves around characters affected by this disaster, including Sally Campbell, a young widow who loves the theater; Margaret, Sally's sister-in-law; Archie, Margaret's husband; and Louis Hue Girardin, a former French viscount who now runs the Hallerian Academy in Richmond. The novel's cast also includes slaves and freedmen like Gilbert, a skilled blacksmith who dreams of buying his own freedom; Cecily, a light-skinned slave who has been tormented by Elliott Price; Maria, Cecily's sister; and Jack, a 14-year-old stagehand dreaming of a stage career.\n\nDuring a performance at the Richmond Theater, Jack notices a chandelier with lit candles that could cause a fire. Despite his concerns, Jack raises the chandelier on Green's orders, which subsequently causes a fire. Amidst panic, audience members try to escape the theater as the building crumbles. Sally and Margaret manage to help several women, including a woman holding her daughter, escape the burning building through open windows. As they search for their missing family and friends, the townspeople debate whether the fire was intentionally set by a group of slaves, causing panic and anger amongst the crowd.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fire, Margaret, Jack, and Anderson, a member of the theater company, face the consequences of the blaze. Gilbert is recognized for his heroic actions in rescuing people from the fire and searches for Louisa Mayo, who is among the missing. Jack is haunted by guilt and fears being exposed for his role in the disaster, while Anderson dismisses Jack's concerns and threatens him if he tries to expose the truth. Meanwhile, Cecily, who survived the fire, realizes she has a unique opportunity to escape slavery since everyone thinks she's dead. She tells her mother, Della, about her plan, and they devise a plan for Cecily to hide in an old boathouse on the Fulcher property. Elsewhere, Sally visits Tom at the Marshalls' house to learn more about Alexander Scott, who was injured in the fire.

Meanwhile, Jack decides to tell the truth about the theater fire to Ritchie, a reporter. Ritchie publishes an apology letter from the company's lead actors in the newspaper, though it's clear the letter is more about selling copies than genuine remorse.\n\nAs Cecily prepares to leave town, she shares an emotional goodbye with her mother, Della.

Muzafar decides to embrace both sons and continues his search with the help of the sisters in white, Shadarya and Lawlaw-i Spi.\n\nMuzafar's journey to understand the mysteries surrounding the Saryases and their connection to his own life serves as a metaphor for the interconnectedness of all human beings. The story explores themes of loss, grief, identity, and the meaning of life. Throughout the story, characters grapple with questions of identity, the meaning of life, and the secrets that bind them together. The mysterious glass pomegranate serves as a symbol of their shared experiences and the unknown connections between their lives.\n\nAs Muzafar continues his search, he visits the grave of the First Saryas every Friday with the sisters in white, who burn candles and incense in his memory. Muzafar feels a deep connection to both Saryases and is determined to find the living Saryas and embrace him as his son. The story also follows the lives of other characters, such as Muhammad the Glass-Hearted, who grows up in a world full of secrets and concealment during the dark years of the revolution.\n\nDuring Muzafar's journey to find his sons, he meets and receives guidance from various characters like Nadim-i Shazada, who has information about the Saryases' past, Taifoor Pasha, who helps locate the fortress where Saryas is kept, and Sayyid Jalal Shams, a wise old man who holds the key to the Saryases' origins. Muzafar and Saryas exchange tapes and share their experiences and fears while seeking out the truth about their past and the events that led to their current situation.\n\nTowards the end of the story, Muzafar prepares to leave his homeland and search for the Last Saryas in a hospital in England. The sisters in white and Ikram-i Kew support him in his decision, and Muzafar takes the gifts given to him by the sisters and a twig from the last pomegranate tree as reminders of his past and the people he encountered during his journey. As Muzafar sets out on his journey to find the Last Saryas, he is determined to embrace his sons and carry their stories as he seeks answers to his questions about identity, loss, and the complexities of life.\n\nThroughout the story, the characters face challenges and come to terms with their pasts, the consequences of their actions, and the impact of their choices on the lives of others. Muzafar's search for his sons symbolizes the human capacity for resilience and the importance of hope in the face of adversity. The Last Pomegranate Tree is a powerful narrative that explores the themes of identity, loss, love, and the search for meaning in life amid chaos and uncertainty.\n\nIn one part of the story, the narrator is aboard a ship, retelling the tale of the Second Saryas, who remains in prison, awaiting a peace deal that will set him free. The narrator struggles with what to share the next night, as his story never ends. He compares the silence of the sea and the endless silence of the Saryases, viewing the two as the same. Despite the approaching storm, the narrator wants to share his story, even at the risk of dying at sea, believing that his voice will be carried far away and remembered by the distant sea, fish, and stars.\n\nThe story serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of human lives and the impacts of choices on the lives of others, urging readers to grapple with existential questions and the secrets that bind people together."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:49:28.478810Z","updated_at":"2023-09-22T20:53:19.246515Z","inner_id":7,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":59,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6659,"annotations":[{"id":2333,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"pk5XvRKTAD","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 1.

Mossa visits Valdegeld and seeks assistance from her old friend Pleiti, a Classics scholar. They interview Bolien's colleagues to learn about his character and research and find out about his visit to the Preservation Institute before his disappearance.\n\nMossa and Pleiti meet Cyla, a staff member at the Institute, who tells them about Bolien's visit to a rock pool environment weeks prior. Mossa requests a bulletin to gather more information about Bolien's last visit. They explore the tourist paths of the Institute to clear their minds and find clues. While there, they are attacked by a loose feline, which Mossa suspects was set on them deliberately.\n\nInjured but determined, Mossa returns to the platform where Bolien disappeared and mentions wanting to talk to a Modern geographer. Pleiti arranges a meeting with three geographers, including Viken Porbal. Porbal suggests superstitious beliefs about the platform's location might have played a role in Bolien's disappearance. Mossa and Pleiti plan to visit the other geographers and return to the Preservation Institute for more information.\n\nAt the Institute, Mossa and Pleiti learn from Frefor, the Director of Operations, that several specimens are missing. They suspect these thefts are related to Bolien's disappearance and involve someone within the Institute. They interview more staff members and find evidence suggesting the feline attack was targeted. They decide to speak to another Modern Geographer to learn more about the platform's significance in the case.\n\nMossa and Pleiti contemplate the implications of the case on the Preservation Institute and resolve to uncover the conspiracy behind Bolien's disappearance and the specimen thefts. They board a railcar to a platform called Frontel, where they believe they may find more clues about Bolien's activities.\n\nAt Frontel, they discover an abandoned gas compression factory and an old-fashioned suspended railcar system. They suspect Bolien may have used the suspended railcar to travel undetected. While investigating the factory, they find Bolien as their prisoner. As they interrogate him, they realize they are missing something vital in their understanding of the case. They take a walk, hoping a change of scenery will help them piece together the puzzle.\n\nDuring their walk, Mossa and Pleiti find themselves in a walled park, where they discuss their feelings for each other and reminisce about their past relationship. They continue to ponder the case when Pleiti realizes that the list of stolen specimens from the Preservation Institute may represent an attempt to create a new ecosystem on Earth. She suspects that Bolien and his conspirators plan to send the specimens to Earth to restart life there, undermining the work of the scholars at Valdegeld University.\n\nMossa and Pleiti decide to travel to Uliram, a spaceport with facilities for extra-orbital travel, to stop the launch of the stolen specimens. On their way, they receive a telegram revealing that the only notable absence from Valdegeld on the specified dates is Rector Spandal, a powerful academic figure who may be involved in the conspiracy. Mossa and Pleiti are shocked but continue their journey to Uliram.\n\nUpon arriving at Uliram, they find the spaceport eerily deserted. They hurry through blast walls and launch pads, feeling the vibrations of the launch mechanism growing stronger. They eventually find a rocket on the fourth launch pad, armored and menacing, and realize they may have arrived just in time to stop the launch.\n\nMossa and Pleiti are determined to confront Rector Spandal and unravel the conspiracy behind the theft of the specimens and Bolien's disappearance. They hope to bring those responsible to justice and protect the reputation of the Preservation Institute and the work of the Valdegeld scholars. As they prepare to face the powerful academic figure and his accomplices, they draw strength from their renewed bond and the knowledge that they are fighting for the greater good.\n\nAt the spaceport, they confront Rector Spandal, who is preparing to launch the rocket containing the stolen specimens. Spandal argues that the Classics scholars are preventing progress, but Mossa and Pleiti try to stop the launch. Spandal escapes on the rocket, leaving them to face his accomplice, Porbal.\n\nMossa and Pleiti subdue Porbal and escape the spaceport just in time to avoid the rocket's launch. They are left with many unanswered questions about the outcome of Spandal's actions and the potential consequences on Earth's future ecosystem. Valdegeld University, the Investigators, and the Earth Resettlement Authority work together to launch a probe to follow Spandal's rocket and gather information about the impact of his actions.\n\nAs they work to understand the repercussions of the case, Mossa and Pleiti grapple with the idea of balancing preservation and progress. They acknowledge that both the Classics scholars' rigid adherence to the past and Spandal's rash actions are flawed approaches. They consider that a new, flexible discipline may be needed to navigate the challenges of Earth's resettlement and preserve the balance of the planet's ecosystems.\n\nIn the end, Mossa and Pleiti find solace in their renewed relationship and the knowledge that they have made a difference in the case. They express their appreciation for each other's strengths and adaptability, and they make plans to visit each other's home planets, Sembla and Valdegeld. As they continue their work as investigators, they remain committed to finding a balance between preserving the past and embracing progress, knowing that their love and partnership will help them face the challenges ahead.","summary_2":"The story follows Mossa, an Investigator, and Pleiti, a Classics scholar at Valdegeld University, as they investigate the mysterious disappearance of a man named Bolien Trewl and the murder of Rechaure. The investigation leads them to uncover a conspiracy involving the theft of biological materials from the Preservation Institute, which is dedicated to preserving Earth's species.\n\nMossa suspects that Bolien's disappearance and Rechaure's murder are connected, and that someone within the Preservation Institute may be involved in the theft. They visit the Koffre Institute for Earth Species Preservation, where they learn that several specimens are missing. Mossa and Pleiti also explore the possibility that Bolien's disappearance is related to the work of a modern geographer.\n\nAs they continue their investigation, Mossa and Pleiti grow closer, rekindling their romantic feelings for each other. They travel to various locations, including an abandoned gas compression factory on the planet Giant, where they find a hidden platform for suspended railcars. They believe that Bolien used this old-fashioned mode of transportation to escape unnoticed.\n\nTheir investigation takes them to a spaceport, where they confront Rector Spandal, a powerful figure in the academic world, who is attempting to launch a rocket to Earth with the stolen biological materials. Spandal believes that the Classics scholars would never agree on when to start Earth's resettlement process, and he is determined to return to Earth, regardless of the risks. During their confrontation, Mossa is attacked by Professor Porbal, but she and Pleiti manage to subdue him and escape the launch platform before the rocket takes off.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Classics scholars debate whether to send a crewed ship with additional biological materials to Earth. Mossa encourages Pleiti to work on finding alternative solutions to Earth's reanimation and resettlement that do not involve mimicking known successes or disrupting collective endeavors.\n\nThroughout the story, Mossa and Pleiti's bond strengthens, and they reflect on how they have changed and grown. They discuss the possibility of visiting each other's hometowns, Sembla and Valdegeld, and express admiration for each other's skills and open-mindedness.\n\nThe story takes place on a planet called Giant, where days and nights are each 32 hours long. The Preservation Institute is under constant pressure to justify its use of resources and space, as living space on Giant is scarce. The protagonist and Mossa navigate the challenges of their investigation, including the involvement of powerful individuals like Rector Spandal, while also grappling with their personal growth and the rekindling of their romantic relationship.\n\nIn the end, Mossa and Pleiti continue their search for the truth behind the conspiracy, determined to protect Earth's future and uncover the connections between Bolien's disappearance, Rechaure's murder, and the theft of biological materials from the Preservation Institute.

She meets her third date, Aaron, a coffee shop owner, at her favorite bar, Blaine's. They bond over their shared experience of losing their parents and enjoy their time together. Aaron invites Aretha to his Brooklyn brownstone, which he owns and uses as a coffee roasting facility. The house is an old brownstone in Brooklyn, renovated in 1950, and has been home to various artists and musicians over the years.\n\nAaron's roommates, Brittany and James, are living an alternative lifestyle as survivalists. They stockpile emergency supplies, practice martial arts for self-defense, and are involved in illegal gun sales. Aretha accidentally discovers a cache of guns in Brittany's room and later goes on a gun run with James. Despite knowing the risks, Aretha feels a thrill from participating in these activities and considers it her \"hobby.\" Throughout the story, Aretha struggles with her impending unemployment and the financial stress it brings. She also grapples with her feelings towards Aaron, wondering if their relationship can be fixed during their vacation. Meanwhile, the termites continue to damage the house, unbeknownst to the occupants.\n\nAretha's relationship with Aaron remains strong, despite her guilt over cheating on him with James. She continues to go on walking dates with Aaron and even receives a self-defense book from him for her birthday. Aretha also becomes more involved in the house's gun-selling business with James, driving around the boroughs to sell and pick up guns. She is thrilled with her increased cut of the sales and feels more alive than ever. As Aretha anxiously awaits news about her job interviews, she contemplates the possibility of starting a new life in Maine, away from the dangers and challenges of her current situation. She has been trying to improve her physical strength by working out with Brittany, who has a large stash of guns in her room. Brittany believes in being prepared for the worst-case scenario and is afraid of other people, particularly white people with guns. Aretha is concerned about the number of guns in the house and the potential danger they pose.\n\nDuring a walk together, Aretha asks Aaron about his interest in survivalism, but he downplays it as more of a hobby and insists that his roommates are more invested in it than he is. Aretha finds herself feeling a sense of safety when she is with Aaron, although she is unsure if it is due to his survivalist beliefs or simply his height and presence. In the end, Aretha decides to stay in the house, despite her concerns about her roommates and their weapons. She finds solace in the history of the house and the life she shares with Aaron. Aretha's life has changed since moving in, but she is willing to accept the excitement and uncertainty that comes with living in the brownstone with her roommates.\n\nAretha and Aaron go on vacation in Maine, but their trip is cut short when they receive a call about damage to their house in New York. They argue about the costs of returning their rental car one-way and the insurance coverage for the house. Upon returning home, they find a significant portion of the roof has collapsed. The couple, along with their housemates Brittany and James, decide to live in a bunker in the backyard that Brittany has prepared with supplies and amenities. Aretha struggles with insomnia as she contemplates the creepiness of their living situation and her perceived failures and fears.\n\nThe group calls three exterminators to deal with the termite problem, with the third one suggesting a more comprehensive approach involving digging up part of the foundation and putting foam in the walls. However, they would also need to hire a wall guy and a ceiling guy, leading to arguments between Aaron and Brittany about the cost of these services. James, meanwhile, seems to be slipping further into his own world, spending time alone in a tent in the yard with a gun and possibly drinking tequila.\n\nIn a darkly humorous turn of events, Aretha forces Brittany and Aaron at gunpoint to pack up all the guns in duffel bags and give her the keys to their backup car. She embarks on a journey to sell the guns to various buyers across New York City, making stops in neighborhoods like Mineola, Bayside, and Staten Island. As she sells the guns and accumulates cash, Aretha reflects on her relationships with Aaron and Brittany, as well as her own motivations for getting involved in the gun-running operation. She decides to keep her Glock for protection, just in case her former friends ever come after her.\n\nAfter completing her gun-selling journey, Aretha reaches out to her friend Nia, apologizing for her past behavior and asking if she can stay at her place. Nia agrees, and Aretha heads to Prospect Lefferts Gardens, where she meets Nia on her porch and shares a vape with her. The story concludes with Aretha exhaling into the dark, symbolizing the release of her past experiences and the beginning of a new chapter in her life.

The story revolves around the British man-of-war ship, the Wager, and its crew, who embark on a secret mission led by Commodore George Anson to capture a treasure-filled Spanish galleon. The protagonist, David Cheap, a first lieutenant who dreams of becoming a captain and escaping his troubled past, is part of the squadron that includes the ships Centurion, Pearl, Gloucester, and others. The British fleet faces many challenges, including a shortage of available crew members, leading to the use of press gangs to forcibly kidnap seafaring men and press them into service.\n\nAs the squadron sets sail, they encounter various challenges, such as storms, sickness, and the loss of ships. The Wager, commanded by Captain Cheap, is shipwrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. Most of the officers and crew perish, but 81 survivors set out in a makeshift boat to find help. After a harrowing journey, 30 of them miraculously reach Brazil, where they are celebrated for their bravery and ingenuity. Six months later, another boat carrying three more survivors lands in Chile, accusing the earlier group of being mutineers and revealing the horrifying events that took place on the island.\n\nThe castaways on Wager Island, including Captain Cheap, gunner John Bulkeley, midshipman John Byron, and others, struggle to survive in the harsh conditions, facing hunger, cold, and internal conflicts. The crew members begin to fracture into warring factions, with some blaming Captain Cheap for their predicament and questioning his authority. Bulkeley emerges as a key figure in the group, leading an excavation team and constructing a large dwelling for himself and other warrant officers. The castaways encounter a group of Kawésqar people, who are skilled navigators and have adapted well to the harsh environment. The castaways realize that these indigenous people might hold the key to their salvation. Despite initial hesitation, the Kawésqar eventually approach the castaways and teach them their methods of survival and provide them with food.\n\nAs the castaways continue to work together to survive, tensions rise between Captain Cheap and the men, particularly with Mitchell and his gang causing trouble. The castaways are faced with a choice between following Captain Cheap's plan to find the commodore and complete their mission or supporting Bulkeley's plan to sail through the Strait of Magellan to Brazil. Most of the crew sign a petition supporting Bulkeley's plan, but Captain Cheap refuses to sign and remains adamant about his original orders. The castaways remain divided, with tensions escalating as both factions gather weapons and prepare for potential conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, Anson and his remaining ship, Centurion, continue their expedition and eventually intercept and capture a Spanish galleon filled with treasure, boosting the nation's morale and earning Anson a promotion. Back on Wager Island, Cheap and the remaining men, including Lieutenant Hamilton, try to repair their boats to rejoin Anson. As they face challenges, they resign themselves to their fate. Bulkeley's group, now in the Strait of Magellan, face their own hardships, but eventually reach Brazil. They become paranoid about conflicting stories and accusations, moving to different lodging places to escape threats. Baynes, the ranking officer, accuses Bulkeley and Cummins of leading the mutiny against Cheap. Bulkeley and Cummins secure passage home, awaiting their court-martial trial.\n\nThe story then shifts to the survivors' return to England, where they face a court-martial. The trial threatens to expose the dark secrets of the crew and the empire they serve. The accused publish their conflicting accounts of the events, each trying to sway the public and the Admiralty in their favor. As the trial commences, both sides face charges of mutiny, theft, and murder. Judges unanimously acquit all except Baynes, who receives a reprimand. After the trial, all involved resume their lives. Cheap is made captain of another ship and retires after capturing a valuable prize, while Bulkeley moves to Pennsylvania and publishes an American edition of his book.\n\nIn summary, The Wager is a captivating tale of survival, betrayal, and the dark side of human nature. It follows the crew of a British man-of-war ship as they embark on a perilous mission, only to find themselves shipwrecked and fighting for their lives. The story explores the motivations and actions of its characters, who must navigate the treacherous waters of their own moral compasses in order to survive.","summary_2":"The story follows David Cheap, a first lieutenant on the Centurion, young midshipman John Campbell, and 16-year-old gentleman volunteer John Byron as they embark on a dangerous naval mission against Spain, seeking redemption and success. Amidst harsh conditions and difficulties, including ship repairs, a lack of sailors, and an outbreak of typhus, Byron struggles to adjust to life on the Wager and maintain the noble aspirations that led him to the Navy. As the fleet learns of an impending attack by a Spanish armada, led by Admiral Pizarro, they scramble to prepare for battle under the guidance of gunner John Bulkeley. With the death of Captain Dandy Kidd and the appointment of David Cheap as the new captain of the Wager, tensions rise as the crew must work together to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals while sailing across the perilous sea.\n\nCheap prepares the Wager to navigate around Cape Horn, encountering unpredictable and dangerous conditions and desolate landscapes. The journey becomes increasingly treacherous as storms, freezing temperatures, and the debilitating disease scurvy wreak havoc on the ships and their crews. The Wager eventually becomes separated from the rest of the fleet, leaving Cheap and his crew to face their destiny alone. Stranded on a desolate island, the castaways set up a makeshift village and form a loose social hierarchy based on their roles on the Wager. Cheap continues to enforce strict rules and regulations to maintain order and morale, but tensions persist, particularly with Bulkeley.\n\nAs winter approaches and their resources dwindle, the castaways confront their desperation and declining resources, the struggle for survival, and the possibility of redemption. In an attempt to escape the island, the crew works together to rebuild a submerged longboat into an ark capable of carrying them away. Cheap develops a plan to save the crew and fulfill their original military mission, while Bulkeley suggests an alternative route through the Strait of Magellan to Brazil. The castaways are divided between Cheap's loyalists and Bulkeley's supporters, with Byron caught in the middle. After presenting a petition to Cheap and being rejected, Bulkeley and his men begin plotting to overthrow Cheap, who in turn strengthens his defenses. As tensions escalate, both factions arm themselves, preparing for a possible conflict within their own ranks.\n\nCheap is ultimately abandoned on the island with a small group of loyalists, including Lieutenant Hamilton and the surgeon Elliot. Meanwhile, Bulkeley, Byron, and the rest of the castaways set sail towards Brazil, leaving Cheap and his followers to their fate. As they embark on their journey, the harsh conditions and lack of food take a toll on the castaways. Despite their desperation, they overcome various obstacles, including treacherous seas and the loss of their cutter. After a miraculous reunion with the cutter and its crew, they press onward. The men face mounting challenges, including starvation and madness, as they eventually reach Port Desire.\n\nCommodore George Anson, who led the expedition, sails across the Pacific and captures the Spanish ship Our Lady of Covadonga, resulting in the largest treasure ever seized by a British naval commander. Anson and his crew return to England as heroes. Long-lost Captain Cheap, Lieutenant Hamilton, and midshipman John Byron eventually return home after more than five years at sea, their fates intertwined and their survival and redemption uncertain. They are taken as prisoners by the Spanish, but ultimately given permission to return home. The castaways face a court-martial, which will decide the truth of their actions and mete out justice, determining whether they are guilty of heinous crimes or can be redeemed for their actions on the island. The trial results in all parties, except for Lieutenant Baynes, being exonerated for their roles in the loss of the Wager. The mutiny on Wager Island remains an unresolved issue, referred to as \"the mutiny that never was.\"\n\nIn the midst of the stormy and treacherous journey around Cape Horn, the crew faces numerous challenges and losses. Cheap battles rheumatism and asthma, while Bulkeley's cutter loses sight of Cheap's boat, forcing them to sail on alone. Crew members struggle with the constant threat of death from drowning or falling overboard, leading to increased desperation and fear among the castaways. Cheap and his remaining loyalists are eventually washed ashore on an island, while Bulkeley and his followers continue their journey to Brazil. Despite being separated, both factions face their own unique challenges - Cheap's group must fend for themselves on the island, while Bulkeley's followers struggle with the hardships of their journey, including starvation and madness.\n\nAs Bulkeley's group sails through treacherous seas, they face mounting challenges, including the loss of their cutter and the debilitating effects of starvation and madness. After a miraculous reunion with the cutter and its crew, they press onward, eventually reaching Port Desire and the potential for rescue and redemption. Meanwhile, Cheap and his remaining loyalists must fend for themselves on the desolate island, their survival uncertain and their futures intertwined with those of the castaways who abandoned them. The story highlights the challenges faced by both factions while they struggle with their harsh circumstances, each seeking redemption and survival in their own way, ultimately resulting in a dramatic and uncertain conclusion. Cheap's loyalists and Bulkeley's followers each have their own tales of struggle and redemption, but their fates remain uncertain as the story concludes."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:49:28.479256Z","updated_at":"2023-09-24T16:40:02.332794Z","inner_id":12,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":59,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6664,"annotations":[{"id":2345,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"rmPMoGZ8RW","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 2.

Mar is the child of the late pirate captain Juan Luis León Rojas, known as El Embrujado, who made a deal with El Diablo sixteen years ago to save Mar's life and grant his crew prosperity. In exchange, Juan agreed to give up his life when the sixteen years were up. The story is set in the summer of 1820, just before Mexico's independence, and features a diverse cast of Latinx pirates inspired by real-life figures like Roberto Cofresí and Diabolito.\n\nThe crew's ship, La Catalina, is destroyed during a storm, and Mar's father is taken by El Diablo. Mar, the sole survivor of La Catalina's destruction, finds themselves aboard La Ana, captained by Alejandro Vega Torres. They struggle with the loss of their father, their home, and their crew, while trying to keep their magia a secret from the new crew. Mar forms a reluctant friendship with Bas, a member of the crew who enjoys teasing them. During their time on La Ana, Mar struggles with their identity and the need to release their magia without revealing their secret to the crew. They are haunted by the memory of La Catalina's quartermaster, Leo, and his delicious paella, which reminds them of happier times. Mar tries to suppress their magia, but it only seems to grow stronger and more uncontrollable with time.\n\nMar and Bas embark on a mission to save their captured crew members from the heavily guarded fortress of El Morro. They receive help from Eralia, a revolutionary, who has close friends imprisoned in El Morro and wants them freed as well. Despite several setbacks, including false information and betrayal, Mar and Bas manage to infiltrate El Morro and rescue their crew.\n\nThroughout the story, Mar is haunted by a demonio named Dami, who persistently tries to make a deal with them. Dami offers Mar a chance to save their father, but they need Mar's magia, not their soul. However, Mar is hesitant to make deals with demons, fearing the consequences. Dami eventually convinces Mar to kill el Diablo, the powerful being who owns Dami's soul, in exchange for delaying the execution of the rest of their crew and providing Mar with a flat chest, which they've always wanted.\n\nMar hesitates but ultimately agrees to the deal. Dami uses their magic to create a hole in the wall of the prison, allowing Mar and Bas to escape. They navigate through a storm and eventually find shelter in a small boardinghouse. Dami transforms into a well-dressed man to secure a room for Mar and Bas. Once inside, Mar asks Dami to heal their concussion, but Dami insists on another deal. Mar begrudgingly agrees to call Dami the greatest, most generous, and most attractive demonio to ever exist. With the deal made, Mar's concussion is instantly healed, and Dami leaves them to rest before discussing their plan to kill el Diablo.\n\nAs the plan is set in motion, Mar and Bas discuss the potential consequences of their actions, including the possibility of hurting innocent people and Spanish soldiers who may be present during the fight. Bas reassures Mar that he can handle the situation and keep them distracted while Mar focuses on el Diablo. Despite their concerns, the group is determined to carry out their mission and save their loved ones from execution.\n\nWhen the time comes to confront el Diablo, Mar finds him in a crowded taberna with Bas, discussing a deal. Mar listens in, trying to find the right moment to attack, but their plans are complicated by the presence of innocent bystanders. As the conversation between Bas and el Diablo continues, it becomes clear that el Diablo wants a rare and powerful soul in exchange for freeing Bas's crew from prison. To Mar's shock, el Diablo reveals that he wants Mar's soul, not Bas's.\n\nFaced with the reality of el Diablo's power and intentions, Mar must decide how to proceed and protect both their own soul and the lives of Bas's crew. In the final battle, Mar uses their powers to defeat el Diablo, saving their father and their crew. They are greeted by el Capitán, Tito, and the rest of their comrades, who have been waiting for Mar's return.\n\nThe story explores themes of identity, family, and the struggle to accept one's true self. Mar's journey to understand and accept their magia parallels their journey to come to terms with their gender identity. The storm that destroys La Catalina and the various challenges Mar and Bas face during their mission serve as metaphors for the turmoil and danger that Mar and their pirate family must face as they navigate their lives on the high seas. The story highlights the existence of queer and trans people throughout history, offering a unique perspective on the challenges they faced in a time when their identities were often misunderstood or ignored.","summary_2":"On their sixteenth birthday, Mar faces their unpredictable magia while on La Catalina during a storm. Their father, Papá, reveals his deal with El Diablo to save Mar's life and ensure prosperity. When the ship catches fire, Mar saves the crew with their magia, honoring Papá's legacy.

Eralia agrees but warns of danger and consequences.\n\nAt a beachside taberna, Mar and Bas execute a plan to confront El Diablo. As Bas distracts El Diablo, Mar seeks the right moment to attack without harming bystanders. El Diablo reveals he wants Mar's soul due to its unique power and rarity. Mar realizes the stakes are higher than ever and must choose between risking innocent lives to attack El Diablo or finding another way to save Papá's soul and protect their friends.\n\nMar and Bas work with Dami on a risky plan: Bas pretends to make a deal with El Diablo as a distraction while Mar attacks him. They hope that when El Diablo frees Dami, he will lose a significant portion of his power, making it easier for Mar to defeat him. However, in the taberna, El Diablo reveals he knows their plan and that Dami has betrayed them.

As the contest on Clock Island begins, Lucy meets the other contestants: Andre, Melanie, and Dustin. They are all former runaways who had come to Clock Island seeking help from Jack Masterson. As they play a series of games, including a scavenger hunt and a Clock Island trivia game, they begin to forget why they are competing and simply enjoy themselves. However, Lucy reminds herself that she must stay focused and win for Christopher.\n\nDuring the competition, Lucy receives a message from her friend Theresa, informing her that Christopher is being transferred to a new family. Believing Jack to be behind the message, Lucy confronts him, but he denies any involvement. Despite the storm raging outside, Lucy is determined to return to California to be with Christopher before he moves. Jack and Hugo, however, try to convince her to stay and finish the game on Clock Island, as winning could provide the money she needs to adopt Christopher.\n\nHugo reveals that he has been living on the island for the past six years to keep an eye on Jack and prevent him from committing suicide. Hugo shares how much his late brother, Davey, loved the Clock Island books and how Jack had been a great support during their family's difficult time. As they continue to discuss the Clock Island books, Hugo reveals the dark secret behind one of the books, \"Goblin Night on Clock Island.\" The story was inspired by Jack's own experience growing up with an alcoholic father who turned into a monster when he was drinking. Lucy is shocked by this revelation but understands the importance of not breaking the spell of the Clock Island stories.\n\nTogether, Lucy and Hugo select five paintings for an exhibit and bond over their shared love for the Clock Island books. Jack calls Hugo and asks him to keep Lucy on the island for another day, as there is someone he wants her to meet. Meanwhile, Christopher is packing his belongings, including his Clock Island books, as he is about to move to a new foster family, the Mattinglys. He hopes that if he proves himself to be a good child, they will let Lucy move in with them too.\n\nLucy meets her estranged sister Angie, who has come to visit her at Jack's house. Angie apologizes for her past behavior and explains her side of the story. As the two sisters reconnect, Angie tells Lucy that she has been in therapy since she was seventeen and that she has learned that children who grow up as the \"favorites\" in families are often more mentally unhealthy than those who are not. She explains that she has been trying to distance herself from their parents and that she has not seen them for years.\n\nIn the final challenge of the contest, Lucy tries calling Christopher for help but is unable to reach him through the phone. Despite Christopher's bravery in answering the phone and finding the passage, Lucy does not win the contest. Hugo tries to console her by offering her a painting of a shark for Christopher as a consolation prize.\n\nAfter the contest, Lucy is approved to foster Christopher and spends the summer bonding with him. Jack had secretly helped Christopher overcome his fear of phones and had been working with a family law attorney, Ms. Hyde, to make the adoption process smoother for Lucy. As Lucy and Christopher settle into their new life on Clock Island, they are surrounded by love and support from their newfound family and friends.\n\nDuring their time on Clock Island, Lucy and Jack plan to start a nonprofit organization to provide free books, backpacks, and school supplies to children in foster care. They want to create care packages postmarked from Clock Island to give hope and joy to kids who need it the most. Despite the challenges they face, Lucy and Christopher find happiness and a sense of belonging in their new home.","summary_2":"One year after the lighthouse on Clock Island suddenly lights up again, Lucy, a teacher's aide, struggles to adopt her student Christopher due to her financial situation and living conditions.

Soon, Lucy, Hugo, and two other contestants, Melanie and Andre, gather in the island's library to begin the game. Following clues, they locate the starting point at a spot called \"Six O'Clock.\"\n\nThroughout their journey, the contestants face fears, uncover secrets, and navigate the mysterious world of Clock Island. Lucy wins the first game easily, believing she might pull off a victory and change her life, allowing her to adopt Christopher without relying on help from others. However, she experiences setbacks when a man claiming to be a lawyer named Richard Markham offers her a large sum of money for Jack's new book, which she refuses.

Fearing for his safety and facing her deepest fear, Lucy determines to win the game, face her fears, and do whatever it takes to adopt Christopher and save him from this situation.\n\nAs they continue to navigate the challenges of the game, Lucy shares her past relationship with Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Sean Parrish, who referred to her as his muse. Despite the glamorous lifestyle she experienced with him, she admits that it was his desire to feel wanted that ultimately led her to stay in the relationship. With Hugo's support, Lucy decides to stay on the island and finish the game in hopes of changing her and Christopher's lives for the better.\n\nWhen Lucy's estranged sister Angie appears on the island, she confronts her past and the pain her sister caused her. Despite her anger and fear, Lucy agrees to talk to Angie, realizing that facing her fears is necessary to overcome them and move forward. As Lucy and Hugo continue to face the challenges of the game, they grow closer and become more determined to achieve their dreams and protect Christopher from the dangers they face.\n\nAlthough they ultimately fail to win the game, their friendship and shared experiences on Clock Island have brought them closer together and given them the strength to face the challenges that lie ahead. As they prepare to leave the island, Jack surprises Lucy by offering her the house on Clock Island, along with the promise of helping her adopt Christopher. Touched by his generosity, Lucy accepts the offer, and they return to the mainland to begin their new lives together.\n\nThree months later, Lucy and Christopher arrive at the airport to reunite with Hugo and Jack. They share a heartfelt reunion, and Lucy introduces Christopher to Jack as her son. As they drive to Clock Island, Lucy and Hugo reflect on the past few months and the happiness they have found in their new lives.

She rebrands herself as \"Juniper Song\" to honor her background and mother's influence. However, when Yale University acquires Athena's drafting notes for their literary archive, June worries that the truth about Athena's involvement in the novel will be exposed. She visits Athena's mother, Mrs. Liu, and convinces her not to donate the notebooks to the archive, ensuring they remain private.\n\nDespite her efforts to hide the truth, June faces criticism for her book, particularly from those who accuse her of exploiting the suffering of Chinese laborers for her own gain. A harsh review from critic Adele Sparks-Sato in the Los Angeles Review of Books particularly affects her. June continues to support aspiring Asian writers, including a young mentee named Emmy Cho, despite the criticism. As June's book becomes a New York Times bestseller, she is invited to speak at various literary events. However, she is haunted by the ghost of Athena, who appears at her book launch and other public appearances. Despite her anxiety, June's career continues to flourish, with a film adaptation of The Last Front in the works with Greenhouse Productions.\n\nThe accusations of plagiarism resurface when a Twitter account named @AthenaLiusGhost claims that June stole Athena's work. The allegations gain traction, and June's reputation is tarnished. Her agent, Brett, and her publisher, Eden, stand by her, but they advise her to remain silent and not engage with the trolls. Juniper's sales increase due to the controversy, but she becomes obsessed with the backlash and struggles to focus on her writing. When Juniper's brother-in-law Tom helps her track down the person behind the Twitter account, she confronts Geoff, Athena's bitter ex-boyfriend, and blackmails him into silence. The controversy dies down, but Juniper's writing career remains uncertain. She considers taking on an intellectual property project with a company called Snowglobe to reignite her passion for writing.\n\nWhile teaching at a Young AAPI Writers' Workshop, June overhears her students discussing the plagiarism controversy and struggles with her guilt and isolation. She tries to focus on helping her students improve their writing, but can't shake the feeling that her career may be over. June visits her mother in Philadelphia and reminisces about her childhood when writing was just a hobby and not a professional career. June decides to write a fictionalized account of her relationship with Athena and the controversy surrounding The Last Front, hoping to confront the scandal head-on and reclaim her place in the literary world. However, she becomes increasingly consumed by the memories of Athena and her ghost, inviting Athena's spirit to speak to her for inspiration and insight.\n\nJune's paranoia and desperation for answers about Athena's ghost escalate when she confronts a stranger named Diana, who she initially mistakes for Athena. June reaches out to her former therapist, Dr. Gaily, for help but is unable to receive therapy due to state licensing restrictions. She agrees to meet Athena's ghost at a location called the Exorcist steps, hoping to get answers and closure. However, she discovers that the ghost is actually a girl named Candice, who blames June for ruining her life and seeks revenge.\n\nCandice reveals that she has been manipulating June through social media, using Athena's login to create fake posts and images, and has recorded June's confession about plagiarizing Athena's work. June attacks Candice to retrieve the evidence, but ultimately falls down a flight of stairs and ends up in the hospital with multiple injuries. Candice plans to expose June and ruin her career with a tell-all memoir, but June decides to fight back by writing her own memoir, presenting her side of the story and casting herself as the victim of a cruel hoax. She hopes that her memoir will be controversial and attract attention, leading to a bidding war among publishers and restoring her reputation in the literary world.\n\nAs June works on her memoir, she imagines the reactions of those who have turned against her and believes that her story will expose the truth about Candice and Athena, ultimately vindicating her in the eyes of the public. Despite her physical and emotional pain, June refuses to let her voice be silenced and is determined to tell her side of the story, no matter the consequences."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:49:28.479593Z","updated_at":"2023-09-24T18:19:52.995537Z","inner_id":16,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":59,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6668,"annotations":[{"id":2349,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"UVG5Ta4E9U","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 1.

Feeling threatened and betrayed, Olivia decides to infiltrate ZodiaCupid by matching with Bennett to expose its flaws.

Leto, a young woman marked for sacrifice due to the black scales on her skin, dreams of greatness but finds her hopes shattered by her impending death. Prince Mathias of Ithaca, responsible for conducting the sacrifices, struggles with guilt and memories of his sister Selene, who was also sacrificed to Poseidon.\n\nLeto is captured and hanged along with eleven other girls. However, she is transformed into a creature like Melantho, a servant of Poseidon. Melantho helps Leto regain her human form, except for the scales on her neck. The two form a bond as they train together, with Leto learning to control her connection to the sea and hide her magical abilities. They devise a plan to break the curse by killing Mathias.\n\nMeanwhile, Mathias discovers his late sister Selene's journal, where she had been trying to break the curse, and he vows to find a solution in her memory. On the island of Pandou, Melantho retrieves the bodies of the sacrificed girls from the sea. As she retrieves Leto, she notices her transformation into a creature like herself, marking her as the last of the twelve. Mathias continues to search for answers about the curse and the deaths of the marked girls, particularly the last oracle girl, Ophelia.\n\nLeto and Melantho infiltrate the palace, posing as Princess Adrasteia and her maid, respectively. Leto maintains her disguise and navigates the palace as she plans to take revenge on Mathias for her previous death. After a failed attempt to push Mathias off a cliff, Leto is left with only nine days to find another solution. She is also troubled by a vision she had of her friend Melantho dying, but she believes it to be a figment of her imagination, as she is not powerful enough to receive visions without performing rituals.\n\nAs the kingdom prepares for a feast to celebrate the upcoming equinox, Mathias and Leto continue to grapple with their feelings of guilt and responsibility. Leto and Melantho struggle with their actions and the weight of their decisions, particularly the killing of an innocent maid. They also grapple with the challenges of their newfound powers and the limitations of their abilities. As they continue their journey, they must navigate the complexities of their relationship and the sacrifices they must make to achieve their goals.\n\nDuring the betrothal feast, Leto confronts Mathias about hiding the truth of the curse from her, emphasizing her right to know about the dark history of the kingdom she will soon be a part of. Mathias swears to Leto that if he could rid his people of this grief, he would. Later, Leto and Melantho decide to try to break the curse again that night. They search for Mathias in his rooms but cannot find him.\n\nLeto and Melantho head to the beach to pray and practice their powers. The two discuss their friendship and the future they dream of, where the girls of Ithaca no longer face death each year. Leto impulsively kisses Melantho, who responds passionately. The two become physically intimate on the beach, their connection growing deeper. Their mission to break the curse and save the marked girls of Ithaca continues, as they navigate the challenges of their powers, their relationships, and the sacrifices they must make.\n\nAs Leto and Melantho work to break the curse, they encounter various challenges and obstacles. Leto is torn between her newfound happiness with Melantho and her duty to complete her mission. The tension between Leto and Mathias is also evident, as she tries to keep her distance while he seeks to grow closer. Eventually, Leto and Mathias share an intimate moment, with Mathias gently kissing Leto. She is torn between her feelings for him and her duty to kill him.\n\nLeto and Melantho decide they must kill Mathias in order to break the curse. They plan to drown him in a fountain, which they believe will allow Poseidon to claim his life. Leto uses her powers over water to pull Mathias into the fountain and drown him. However, Melantho begins to drown as well, indicating that their fates are intertwined. Leto hesitates to kill Mathias, fearing that Melantho's life will be lost too. Instead, she saves Melantho and leaves Mathias alive but unconscious.\n\nLater, Mathias agrees to help Leto and Melantho save their kingdom from the curse. As the characters struggle with their feelings, motivations, and the sacrifices they must make, they work together to achieve their goals. In the end, Mathias sacrifices himself to break the curse, saving the twelve marked girls and allowing Leto and Melantho to live on with the hope of a brighter future for Ithaca.","summary_2":"Leto, condemned to die, escapes her cell but is recaptured by Prince Mathias. He sentences her to death to appease Poseidon and save Ithaca. Leto is transformed and awakens on Pandou, meeting Melantho. After finding his sister Selene's journal, Mathias vows to break Ithaca's curse.\n\nOn Pandou, Melantho tells Leto that killing Mathias before the spring equinox will break the curse. Leto agrees out of vengeance. Meanwhile, Mathias searches for clues and discovers a damaged prophecy concerning his birth and death.\n\nLeto trains with Melantho on Pandou, honing her powers and strengthening her resolve to break the curse. Mathias investigates Olympia's ruined temple and Vathi village, where he learns of an oracle girl named Cressida's execution.\n\nLeto and Melantho infiltrate an Athenian ship to escape Pandou. They rescue Princess Adrasteia, who doesn't want to marry Mathias, and assume her identity and that of her servant. They return to Ithaca in their new roles.\n\nIn Ithaca, Leto, pretending to be Adrasteia, meets Mathias. She sends away Alexios, the royal guard head who witnessed her execution. With nine days before the equinox, Leto takes Mathias near the cliff where she intends to kill him.\n\nDuring the betrothal feast, Melantho disappears. Leto follows Mathias's advice to get some air, and Melantho decides to leave after Mathias is dead. Overwhelmed with memories, Leto kisses Melantho, deepening their bond. Later, Mathias summons Leto to the war room but dismisses Melantho.\n\nTheir plan involves drowning Mathias in a fountain. Leto sends him a midnight invite to the fountain, which he accepts without suspicion. She painfully drowns him using her powers.\n\nLater, Leto and Mathias search the palace for clues about the curse and oracles. They find the oracle's inaccessible chambers and a small bottle in the ruins of Leto's mother's room. Meanwhile, Melantho leaves, distraught.\n\nThe queen confronts Leto about her mother's death, her attempt to break the curse long ago, and her defiance's consequences for her family. Leto's relationship with Mathias is strained, but she remains determined to break the curse and save him, conflicted by her love for Melantho and the potential sacrifices.\n\nTo shield Melantho from the truth, Leto suggests searching the palace cellars. They become lost, find a hidden room with statues of the first maids, including Melantho, and learn she lied about her past. The queen's sudden arrival causes friction with Mathias. Leto leaves to locate Melantho, who has vanished, and finds her injured and bleeding, having a vision of Melantho's imminent death while trying to rescue her.\n\nWith Melantho injured, Leto takes her to Vathi for safety before returning to complete her task of killing Mathias and breaking the curse. Melantho admits she's the last girl Poseidon will allow to rise again. Despite the risks and her love for both Mathias and Melantho, Leto agrees to continue.\n\nBack at the palace, Leto faces Mathias, who knows her real identity and intentions. Although they have feelings for each other, Leto is determined to kill Mathias to save the marked girls. She poses a threat with her water-controlling powers, admitting her pain and guilt. Mathias concedes he cannot comprehend Leto's and the girls' suffering, reaching a mutual understanding.\n\nThey decide to find another way to break the curse and save the girls without killing Mathias. They promise to protect each other and Ithaca's innocent girls, despite the uncertain future.\n\nIn a tragic twist, they uncover a prophecy revealing Mathias must choose to die to break the curse. After spending a passionate night together, Leto accompanies Mathias to the shore. Mathias sedates himself and allows the ocean to claim him. As he dies, Leto is left with Melantho, now mortal again, facing the future knowing they saved the marked girls and broke the curse but at the cost of Mathias's life.\n\nHeartbroken, Leto begs the gods to return Mathias and Melantho to her. The gods answer with a vision of a bright and prosperous future for Ithaca, with Melantho and Mathias happy and at peace. The vision also depicts the land blooming with daffodils, signifying the end of the curse and a new chapter for Ithaca.\n\nDespite losing Mathias and Melantho, Leto finds solace knowing she saved the marked girls and broke the curse.

The performers, also known as Sparks, display their abilities to captivate the audience, but Rin knows there is a line they cannot cross, as the same people who cheer for the Sparks could also send them to sanitariums if they realize the magic is real.\n\nThe story also follows Edward, a young man who has left the horrors of World War I behind and lives with Ruth, a girl with a teleportation Spark, and her mother, Mrs. Dover. Edward discovers he has a Spark that allows him to control people's actions with his words, which complicates his relationship with Ruth.

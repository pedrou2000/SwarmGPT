Throughout the journey, Jana and Anil manage their complicated relationship as they care for Imani and participate in the wedding festivities.\n\nIn Tanzania, Jana encounters Dr. Lopez, who interviewed her for a job, making her question the small world they inhabit.

Jana had a passionate affair with Anil Malek while working on a project in Tajikistan, but their relationship ended when Jana discovered Anil was married. Two weeks later, she found out she was pregnant with Imani. Despite their complicated past, Jana and Anil have managed to co-parent amicably through a co-parenting agreement they manage through an app.\n\nJana, Imani, and Rashida travel to Tanzania for a family friend's wedding, where Jana is a bridesmaid and Imani, the flower girl. Jana hopes to land her dream job at Think Canada during the trip, which would allow her to work from Toronto and be there for Imani when she starts kindergarten. Unexpectedly, Anil joins the trip as a groomsman in the wedding. Jana is not happy about his presence, but her mother is delighted by the prospect of them being together as a family for the trip.\n\nWhile in Tanzania, Jana struggles with her feelings for Anil and the fact that her mother lied to everyone about them being divorced. Anil knows about the lie and promises to help Jana get a job with Dr. Lopez, the executive director of Think Canada, in exchange for considering taking him along on a Disney trip with Imani. Jana agrees to pretend that she and Anil are friendly ex-spouses for the sake of her mother and the job opportunity.\n\nDuring their time in Tanzania, the group goes on a weeklong safari trip, visiting various national parks and staying at luxury resorts. Jana tries to focus on her \"letting loose\" list, hoping that it will help her feel more connected and enjoy the trip. However, her feelings for Anil continue to resurface, especially during moments of closeness, such as when they care for Imani together during her illness.\n\nJana and Anil reconnect physically after a long time apart. Despite their complicated past and current relationship, they agree to spend one night together, with no promises or holding back. Jana wakes up the next morning feeling scared and uncertain about what this means for their future. She tells Anil that she needs time to process what happened and that they will talk later.\n\nThroughout the trip, Jana reflects on her past with Anil and how their relationship has evolved over time. She realizes that she has not moved on from Anil and is still affected by the consequences of their relationship. As the trip comes to an end, Jana is left with the decision of whether to forgive Anil and move forward for the sake of their daughter or continue to hold onto her resentment and bitterness.\n\nJana's life becomes more social than ever, with regular outings with her friends, the #BridalBrigade chat group, and even keeping in touch with Nadia, Anil's ex-girlfriend. Jana and Anil's relationship is stronger than ever, and they are planning to buy a three-bedroom house near Imani's school with the help of Anil's real estate agent.\n\nJana is offered a job as the director of research and programs at Think Canada by Dr. Lopez, who assures her that her personal life and past mistakes do not affect her professional abilities. Jana starts her new job and meets her new colleagues, who seem friendly and welcoming. She is relieved that no one seems to know or care about her past reputation.\n\nOne day, Jana receives a delivery of souvenirs from Tanzania and is surprised to find Dr. Lopez at her door, offering to help her with the boxes and drive her mother to a dinner party. Jana is both delighted and nervous to see him, as she still doesn't know if she is in the running for the job at Think.\n\nJana realizes she is in love with Anil and decides to fight for him. She starts by texting him more often and suggesting they do things together as a family. However, Anil seems hesitant, and Jana wonders if he's not interested or just not getting her hints. She finally takes a risk and asks him out on a date, to which he agrees.\n\nIn the end, Jana and Anil have a heartfelt conversation about their feelings and past mistakes. They both express their commitment to making their relationship work and to being great parents for Imani. Jana and Anil's love for each other and their daughter Imani is evident as they navigate the challenges of their past and present, ultimately finding happiness and stability in their relationship. The story is a testament to the power of love, forgiveness, and personal growth, as well as the importance of family and friendship. The setting of Tanzania and the experiences they share together, such as the game drives and staying in luxurious tents, play a significant role in bringing them closer together."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:47:23.666560Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T19:44:10.124337Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":56,"updated_by":5,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6593,"annotations":[{"id":2297,"completed_by":5,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"Q21TnjLdMU","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"DvqFd3U-yT","from_name":"structure","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"mNRJ-twpfJ","from_name":"logic","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["While Summary 1 has more detail, a lot of it is unnecessary.

Along her journey to the Port of Los Angeles, she endures a wagon ride with the spiteful Mr. Cole. Once onboard her ship to Seattle, Adelaide finds herself without a cabin and must spend the journey on deck. She eventually arrives in Big Sandy, Montana, where she meets Jerrine Reed and wagon driver Mr. Olsen.\n\nAdelaide joins the Mudge family, a mother with four blind sons, on their journey to homestead. Both Adelaide and the Mudges face challenges and skepticism from those around them, but their determination to succeed drives them forward. They all endure the harsh Montana weather and confront their personal difficulties, with Adelaide reminiscing about her parents and the life she left behind. On Adelaide's homestead, she finds herself in a tiny cabin with no neighbors and faces isolation. Mr. Olsen returns to her with the Mudge family's abandoned belongings, which help Adelaide establish her home.\n\nWith winter approaching, Adelaide must rely on her determination and resourcefulness to survive in the harsh, empty landscape. She eventually meets neighbors Grace and Sam Price, who provide her with some supplies and companionship. However, Adelaide continues to be haunted by the Mudges' disappearance and the heavy steamer trunk she keeps locked at the foot of her bed. Adelaide suspects that Mrs. Mudge, now going by the name Rose Morrison, and her boys have stolen horses and are on the run.\n\nOne day Adelaide meets Matthew Kirby, a young man who is part of a nearby camp. They share a night of intimacy, but Matthew secretly unlocks Adelaide's steamer trunk, releasing the monstrous creature that attacks him. Adelaide manages to subdue the creature and lock it up again in the trunk, which she later moves to the root cellar. As Matthew recuperates, Adelaide reveals the creature's history and her family's connection to it.\n\nThe Mudge family reappears, attacking Grace and her son Sam, leaving them injured and terrified. Adelaide helps nurse them back to health and must confront the reality of the Mudges' true intentions. She eventually obtains a horse named Obadiah and returns to her cabin, only to find that the creature has broken out of the trunk. Adelaide decides to co-exist with the creature, determining her defiance against the fear and secrecy that has plagued her life.\n\nAs Adelaide continues to build her life in Montana, she attends a show hosted by Jerrine Reed at the Big Sandy Opera House with Grace and Sam. During the event, Adelaide experiences moments of closeness and acceptance with Sam that make her reflect on her past and her relationships with the people around her. She must navigate the complexities of her past and her relationships with the people around her, all while protecting the secret hidden in her root cellar. Meanwhile, Mr. Reed, who is unaware of his wife's knowledge of his favorite card game, drinks and plays cards with Bertie Brown and Fiona Wong at the Blind Pig. The night ends with a ride in Mr. Reed's new Maxwell car, driven by a young man named Joab, who claims to have a lion's heart and serves a great king. Delmus Mudge, Joab's brother, is given a job as a ranch hand by Jack Reed, unaware of Joab's private motive to track down the creature that killed their family.\n\nAdelaide, Bertie, and Fiona ride to town together, where they witness a crowd gathered around Mrs. Jerrine Reed and a woman named Mrs. Sterling. The reason for the commotion is unclear, but it seems to involve Mrs. Sterling's son, Melvin. Adelaide is intrigued, but Bertie and Fiona seem uninterested and enter the Gregson Springs Hotel without further investigation. Later, Adelaide attends the unveiling of Mrs. Sterling's power laundry business, feeling torn between curiosity and loyalty to her friends, Bertie and Fiona. This marks the first time Adelaide feels like a part of the town's community, but her complex relationships and secrets threaten her newfound sense of belonging.\n\nTensions rise between Delmus and Joab Mudge when Delmus confronts Mr. Reed about the truth behind Joab's newfound loyalty to him. The brothers' confrontation ends violently, leaving their futures uncertain as they grapple with their past deeds and the monster they have encountered. Adelaide, Bertie, and Fiona's search for the creature leads them to a cave, where Adelaide confronts the monstrous creature, now revealed to be her sister, Elizabeth, who has grown into a massive, winged beast. Adelaide apologizes for her past actions and offers herself as a sacrifice, but is instead consumed by the flames of Elizabeth's breath, symbolizing her acceptance and forgiveness.\n\nIn the Big Sandy Opera House, three women are about to be hanged by Jerrine Reed and her associates. Adelaide arrives, barely recognizable due to her injuries, and pleads for their lives, offering a second chance to Mrs. Reed. As the situation unfolds, Adelaide reveals that the monstrous creature is her sister, Elizabeth. Meanwhile, Grace, Bertie, and Fiona break into the Reeds' mansion, searching for Sam and encountering Joab, who fires six shots at the door. The women overpower Joab, preventing him from harming them or Sam.\n\nThe story is based on historical accounts of lone women homesteaders in Montana during this period, as introduced to the author, Victor LaValle, through a book titled Montana Women Homesteaders: A Field of One's Own, edited by Dr. Sarah Carter. The author chose the real town of Big Sandy, Montana for its location and history, but heavily fictionalized its events and characters, such as the opera house and the people who tried to kill Bertie, Fiona, Grace, and Adelaide.","summary_2":"In 1915, Adelaide Henry, a young African-American woman, flees her family's farm in California's Lucerne Valley after a secret sin leads to the death of her parents. She sets fire to the house with her parents' bodies inside, hoping to erase her past. Adelaide carries a mysterious locked steamer trunk with her, which holds a secret connected to her past. With the help of a wagon man named Mr. Cole, Adelaide travels towards the Port of Los Angeles, planning to start anew.\n\nAdelaide boards the S.S. Queen in San Pedro, which takes her to Seattle. There, she purchases a homestead in Montana, near the small town of Big Sandy. Upon arriving in Big Sandy, Adelaide meets Fred Harnden, a local newspaper reporter, and Mrs. Jerrine Reed, a wealthy and influential woman. Mrs. Reed advises Adelaide to look for Mr. Olsen, an honest wagon driver, who agrees to take her and her steamer trunk to her new homestead along with a family called the Mudges, consisting of a mother and her four blind sons.\n\nDuring their journey through the Badlands, Adelaide panics when Mrs. Mudge falls onto her steamer trunk, fearing the secret it contains. Adelaide eventually moves into an isolated cabin in Montana, still carrying the heavy trunk. She hangs the key to the lock on a nail by the oven and checks it each night before sleep. Adelaide starts a new life on a claim she won in a poker game, befriending her neighbors, Grace and Sam Price. Grace is a single mother and a teacher, and Sam is her curious, energetic nine-year-old son. However, Adelaide remains protective of her steamer trunk and the secret it holds.\n\nOne day, Adelaide discovers a creature hiding in her cabin, which she believes is a demon that has been haunting her since her birth. She confronts the creature and tries to understand the nature of the curse it has placed on her. Throughout the story, Adelaide grapples with the challenges of living in a harsh environment, as well as the secrets and burdens she carries with her.\n\nAdelaide eventually shares her family secret with her friends Fiona, Bertie, Grace, and Sam. Her sister Elizabeth was born with deformities and considered an abomination by the midwife. Their father, Glenville Henry, raised Elizabeth in isolation with the rest of the family. Adelaide reveals that the creature she has been hiding is her sister Elizabeth, who has become a demon.\n\nWith the help of her friends, Adelaide sets out to find Elizabeth in the Bear Paw Mountains. Meanwhile, a group of white men led by Jack Reed, including Finn and Matthew Kirby, are hunting for Adelaide. They destroy her cabin and decide to head to the Blind Pig, a homebrew business run by Bertie and Fiona, to find her.\n\nAs Adelaide, Bertie, and Fiona approach the mountains, they prepare to leave their horses behind and continue on foot to find Elizabeth. During their journey, Adelaide is snatched away by a mysterious force and encounters Carlota and Francisco, who claim to have seen Elizabeth. Adelaide follows tracks she believes belong to her sister and discovers that Elizabeth has grown immensely in size. Elizabeth breathes fire, seemingly consuming Adelaide in flames.\n\nBack in Big Sandy, Mrs. Reed accuses Grace, Fiona, and Bertie of being witches and causing the deaths and fear in the town. She has them stand on Adelaide's steamer trunk with nooses around their necks, ready to hang them. Adelaide enters the opera house, battered and bloody, pleading for a second chance for the women. Elizabeth appears and the women are cut down from the nooses.\n\nGrace reunites with her son, Sam, and they notice that they are all covered in blood, which they assume is not their own. They take Joab's pistol and lead him outside, where they are joined by Mrs. Henry, who played a part in killing his mother. Despite Joab's anger towards her, Mrs. Henry saves his life by asking Elizabeth to spare him. Elizabeth obeys and leaves Joab alive.\n\nJoab steals some furs and uses them to cover his brother Delmus's body, which he finds in the backseat of a car. He decides to give up a life of crime and enlists in the Navy at the age of thirteen. Meanwhile, Grace and the other Lone Women decide to stay in Montana and settle in an abandoned town.\n\nThroughout the story, Adelaide and her friends face the challenges of living in a harsh environment, as well as the secrets and burdens they carry with them. As they search for Elizabeth and deal with the dangers and prejudices of their time, they form a deeper bond through their shared experiences and understanding of family responsibilities."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:47:23.666679Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T20:20:24.206187Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":56,"updated_by":5,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6594,"annotations":[{"id":2299,"completed_by":5,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"zELLDKTF_S","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["This was initially hard, but focusing on the details that matter made it easier.

Maddie's mother frequently travels to Ghana, leaving her to care for her father and manage their family affairs. Her brother, James, is often absent and avoids contributing to the family expenses.

Despite her frustration, Maddie continues to work on the project and tries to get more involved in the publishing process.\n\nMaddie meets Ben Featherstone at a theater event, and they begin dating. Their relationship becomes intimate, but Maddie struggles with her anxiety and insecurities about her virginity. As their relationship progresses, Maddie discovers that Ben is also dating another woman, Sophie, and treating her better than Maddie, possibly due to racial bias. Maddie's friends, Nia and Shu, support her through this difficult time and encourage her to find someone who is actively anti-racist and understanding of her history.\n\nMaddie's father passes away, leaving her to deal with the emotional and financial burden of his funeral. Her relationship with her mother and brother becomes strained as they argue about who should contribute to the funeral expenses. Maddie is overwhelmed by her grief and feels guilty for not spending more time with her father when he was alive. During this time, Maddie starts using a dating app and meets Alex, a bisexual white man.

She was offered the job by Saje Bernsson after struggling with poverty and working as a dishwasher. Her parents, Chinese immigrants who were sent to labor camps during the Cultural Revolution, moved to America and became piano teachers. The protagonist received a full scholarship to a prestigious conservatory in New York City.\n\nAt Holistik, she meets Helen and Lilith, who introduce her to the world of beauty and wellness. She becomes friends with them and is drawn to their glamorous lifestyle. The protagonist undergoes a transformation due to the products she has been using from the store, but also experiences strange incidents, like her eyes becoming unnaturally large and her legs growing longer overnight. She later learns that her parents have been taking supplements from Holistik, which are found to contain traces of human bone and flesh, causing them to develop a rare disease called kuru.\n\nThe protagonist also works a second job in the sex industry, called Apothecare, to support her parents in their care facility. She undergoes invasive procedures and is monitored by a device called a mandala, which tracks her emotions and well-being. Her relationship with Helen and Lilith deepens, but she also discovers their secrets, including Helen's health issues and Lilith's past as a journalist investigating Holistik and Victor.\n\nAs the protagonist learns more about the dark side of Holistik and the secrets surrounding her friends, she struggles with her own identity and the loss of her parents' memories and stories. She decides to stop taking the supplements and destroys the mandala that had been causing her pain. The protagonist also reconnects with her past as a pianist and seeks to find her own identity separate from her parents and her friends at Holistik.\n\nDuring one of her treatments at the Conservatory, Saje interrupts and takes the protagonist, Anna, to the Gunks. She wakes up in a room with Victor, who offers her a partnership in a project involving the creation of \"hybrids\" - children born through a revolutionary procedure called Everlasting. The procedure would result in shorter pregnancies and no changes to a woman's body. Victor proposes that Anna become a volunteer for the project, but she is confused and unsure about her role in it.\n\nAnna later finds herself in a nightmarish scene, surrounded by unconscious or deformed girls, including Astrid and Lilith. She witnesses Victor, Saje, and Henry dragging more bodies to the pile. As she tries to save Lilith, she hears the sound of approaching winged creatures and decides to take action. Anna pushes a massive lens to redirect the sunlight onto Victor, Saje, and Henry, causing them to catch fire.\n\nThe protagonist wakes up in a hospital after a fire at Organic Provisions farm, with her body severely disfigured. She has lost the use of her hands and her skin has become green and pocked. The protagonist learns that her disfigurement is a result of the pills and supplements she was taking at her workplace, which caused violent changes in her body. Despite her new appearance, she finds a sense of power and freedom in embracing her ugliness.\n\nThe protagonist visits Sally Brown, who has undergone reconstructive surgeries and regained her beauty. Sally was involved in illegal activities at Organic Provisions, including testing dangerous products on humans and inseminating young women with animal sperm without their knowledge. The protagonist confronts Sally about her actions and the harm she caused to others, including their mutual friend Helen.\n\nAs she adapts to her new life and appearance, the protagonist starts playing piano again to keep her hands from becoming too stiff.

The story delves into the history of human evolution, tracing the Tree of Life concept back to the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). Bacteria and viruses have played crucial roles in shaping human history, such as the Neolithic Revolution, the Black Death, and the Industrial Revolution. The story also discusses the colonization attempts of Europeans in the Americas, the Caribbean, and West Africa, and how infectious diseases played a crucial role in the outcomes.\n\nThe protagonist finds themselves in a mysterious situation marked by the code \"143150124.\" As they navigate through this enigmatic world, they encounter various characters and challenges that force them to confront their deepest fears and desires. Along the way, they must decipher the meaning behind the code and ultimately determine their own fate. The protagonist wakes up in an unfamiliar place, unsure of how they arrived there. They soon realize that they are not alone, as they encounter a diverse group of characters who have also been brought to this strange world. Each character has their own unique background and motivations, which are gradually revealed as the story unfolds.\n\nThroughout history, pandemics have driven significant political and economic transformations, revealing the weaknesses of corrupt and incompetent leaders, exacerbating social divisions, and encouraging people to question the status quo. The story explores various examples of how diseases have shaped human history, from the Neanderthals' extinction due to pathogens carried by Homo sapiens, to the Spanish conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires, aided by Old World pathogens. The story also highlights the importance of political decisions in improving public health, citing the massive investments in drinking water, sanitation, housing, and poverty reduction made in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nAs the group explores their surroundings, they discover that they are trapped in a series of interconnected rooms, each marked with a different number. The protagonist becomes fixated on the mysterious code \"143150124,\" believing that it holds the key to their escape. They embark on a quest to decipher the code, enlisting the help of their newfound friends along the way. Throughout their journey, the characters face a series of challenges and obstacles that test their physical, mental, and emotional limits. They must confront their past traumas and personal demons, forcing them to reevaluate their priorities and motivations. The protagonist, in particular, is haunted by memories of a failed relationship and a deep sense of guilt over a past decision.\n\nThe emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is identified as a potential source of the next great pandemic, with more than 1.2 million people dying each year from previously treatable infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The author calls for a proactive response to the existential threat posed by infectious diseases, learning from history to avoid repeating past mistakes.\n\nAs the group delves deeper into the enigmatic world, they begin to uncover hidden truths about their own lives and the nature of the mysterious code. They discover that the code is not simply a means of escape, but rather a representation of the interconnectedness of their lives and the choices they have made. The protagonist comes to understand that the code is a reflection of their own personal journey, and that they must confront their past in order to move forward.\n\nThe climax of the story occurs when the protagonist finally deciphers the code, revealing a door that leads to a room containing a mirror. As they gaze into the mirror, they are confronted with the reality of their own actions and the consequences of their choices. The protagonist is forced to acknowledge their past mistakes and accept responsibility for their actions, ultimately realizing that they have the power to shape their own destiny.\n\nIn the end, the protagonist and their friends are able to escape the mysterious world and return to their own lives, forever changed by their experiences. The code \"143150124\" serves as a reminder of the importance of self-reflection and personal growth, as well as the power of human connection and the strength that can be found in the face of adversity. The story concludes by emphasizing the importance of seizing the opportunity presented by the COVID-19 pandemic to address the problems plaguing modern society and build a happier and healthier world. The Chinese government's strict lockdown measures in response to Covid-19 have been successful in controlling the virus, but at a high cost to individual freedom and economic activity. This approach has the potential to cause mental health problems, political protest, and economic hardship. As the story concludes, it is clear that bacteria and viruses have played a significant role in shaping human history and that addressing health inequalities and the impact of infectious diseases requires a focus on social justice and economic policy.","summary_2":"Pathogenesis explores the discovery of bacteria and viruses, their roles in shaping human evolution, and the relationship between microbes and humans. It delves into the impact of microbes on history, human societies, politics, and evolution. Ancient DNA studies offer insight into the complex history of human populations, the spread of farming, and the relationship between infectious diseases and human development.\n\nInfectious diseases significantly influenced the rise and fall of empires and the spread of culture. The Antonine Plague brought the Pax Romana to an abrupt end, causing economic collapse and weakening the Roman army. The Plague of Cyprian led to a rise in Christianity, the transformation of the Roman Empire, and ultimately its decline.\n\nThe Black Death played a crucial role in the decline of medieval Europe and the emergence of the modern world. Quarantine measures were established to protect populations, and the devastating impact of the Black Death and recurring outbreaks changed society, politics, and the economy across the continent. The rise of the Ottomans and challenges to the Catholic Church emerged in the wake of the Black Death, leading to the Reformation and the rise of Protestantism and secularism. The transition from feudalism to capitalism was also influenced by the Black Death.\n\nIn conquering the Americas, the conquistadors greatly benefited from Old World pathogens, which decimated indigenous populations. The Spanish exported massive amounts of silver, resulting in a global economy but also leading to their decline due to its falling value.\n\nInfectious diseases played a crucial role in the development of Africa, where Europeans faced malaria and yellow fever. Unlike in the Americas, powerful native states resisted European colonizers, leading to limited colonization and influence. The emergence of American slavery and the ideology of racism were greatly affected by infectious diseases. The introduction of West African pathogens into the Caribbean resulted in racialized slavery and increased reliance on African labor.\n\nThe Haitian Revolution demonstrated the vulnerability of white plantation owners in the Caribbean, who faced not only an angry enslaved population but also the threat of infectious diseases. Britain banned the Atlantic slave trade in 1807 in an attempt to stabilize the institution, but further uprisings occurred in the following years.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution resulted in significant increases in productivity, wealth creation, population growth, and urbanization. However, life expectancy in Britain stagnated due to the \"4 Ds\": disruption, deprivation, disease, and death. The urban poor faced harsh living conditions while cities allowed infectious diseases, like cholera, to thrive. Political reforms and the New Poor Law exacerbated the problems faced by the urban poor, as it focused on punishing the \"undeserving\" rather than addressing external factors leading to destitution.\n\nThe sanitary movement in mid-nineteenth-century Britain, driven by figures like Edwin Chadwick, sought to improve public health through integrated water and sewerage systems. However, resistance from local governments and a focus on keeping taxes low hindered progress. The Second Reform Act in 1867 enfranchised working-class men, leading to a new political climate that supported sanitary reform and public health improvements. Joseph Chamberlain's leadership in Birmingham exemplified this shift, as he implemented a strategy of municipal activism and investment in infrastructure. By the early twentieth century, urban death rates and cholera outbreaks had significantly decreased due to these efforts.\n\nIn contrast, Hamburg's political structure and focus on trade led to a lack of attention to sanitation and public health, culminating in a devastating cholera outbreak in 1892. The crisis prompted reforms in the city, including the creation of a professional civil service and improvements in public health infrastructure. Cholera's decline in Europe was ultimately due to improvements in hygiene and sanitation driven by political reform, rather than medical advancements.\n\nIn the twentieth century, China managed to massively reduce the burden of infectious disease. Despite its tumultuous history and limited economic growth, health improved rapidly due to a focus on public health and traditional Chinese medicine. By 1980, life expectancy in China had increased to 66.8 years. One of the most effective campaigns in this effort was mass immunization, leading to a significant drop in infectious diseases such as smallpox, the plague, and TB. The introduction of \"barefoot doctors\" in the mid-1960s significantly contributed to the decline in infectious diseases, as these part-time physicians and public health workers provided basic medical care and raised awareness about sanitation and vaccination in rural areas.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic highlighted stark inequalities between countries and within high-income countries. In rich nations, poor people tend to have jobs they cannot do from home, travel by public transport, and live in crowded housing, often with multiple generations. As a result, they are more likely to be exposed to pathogens than wealthier people. Poor people are also more likely to have risk factors that could make them very ill if they contract Covid-19, such as obesity and non-communicable diseases like diabetes, asthma, or chronic lung disease. In the UK, adults in the poorest parts of the country were almost four times more likely to die from coronavirus than those in the wealthiest areas. In the U.S., death rates were four and a half times higher among the poorest people than those with the highest incomes at the height of the pandemic.\n\nIn this summary, we learn about some individuals and locations involved in the story, such as Jeremy Deller, Demerara (Guyana), and the Democratic Party (U.S.).

Tasked with protecting the disciples selected to represent their respective guilds, Damian's journey begins with the mysterious death of Leonzio Bianchi, a disciple of Death, who is found dead in his room with indications of poisoning. Chief Magistrate Forte tasks Damian with investigating Leonzio's death and threatens to send him back to the ongoing war in the north if he fails. Feeling guilty for not being present when Leonzio died, Damian enlists the help of his friend Enzo, a serving boy at the Palazzo, and Giada de Luca, a disciple of Cunning. Meanwhile, Roz, a disciple of Patience, navigates the bustling night market of Ombrazia, a city divided into six sectors for each of the remaining original saints. Roz is the daughter of a traitor, and she struggles with her feelings about her role in the temple and her relationships with those around her, including her former lover, Damian Venturi.\n\nDamian and Roz begin working together to solve the mysterious deaths in Ombrazia, including that of Amélie, a member of their city's ruling class. As they investigate, they discover a connection between the victims: their eyes were replaced with black orbs, and they were poisoned with vellenium, a rare plant associated with the ancient disciples of Chaos. Damian's father, General Battista Venturi, had instructed the coroner to redact the name of the poison from the reports, causing Roz to suspect his involvement in the murders. Throughout the story, Damian and Roz struggle with their complicated past, their differing loyalties, and their unresolved feelings for each other. They share an intimate moment in a bathhouse, where Damian admits that he has always regretted not being the one to initiate their first kiss, and Roz tells him that she never truly hated him.\n\nDamian is eventually kidnapped by Russo and Serino, who blame him for the death of their brother, Michele, during the war. Damian is taken to a ship full of young soldiers and is forced to wear a military uniform. Roz, along with security officers Kiran and Siena, form a plan to rescue Damian, believing he is in danger and should not be sent back to war. As they set off on their mission, Roz contemplates the complexities of the situation and the relationships between the characters. Meanwhile, Damian is in a state of confusion and fear, questioning his reality after discovering the corpse of Chief Magistrate Forte in a secret tunnel within the Shrine. He suspects the disciples of Chaos might be involved in the murders, but his father, Battista, dismisses his concerns as delusions and sends him back to war.\n\nRoz, Siena, and Kiran rescue Damian from the military ship, and Damian reveals his suspicions about his father's involvement in the murders and the strange events at the Palazzo. Roz and Damian decide to investigate the hidden room and the possibility of a Chaos disciple. They become intimate, and Damian wonders if the saints allowed him to live so that he could love Roz Lacertosa. Meanwhile, Piera Bartolo, a tavern owner and rebel leader, prepares for a risky mission to free imprisoned members and others from the prison before they are sent to fight in the war.\n\nRoz is devastated by Piera's death and is expelled from the rebellion. Damian wakes up and searches for Roz, who he believes might be in danger. He encounters a masked rebel woman, who turns out to be Roz.

Roz confronts General Battista Venturi, who she believes is responsible for the deaths of her father and several others. In a moment of decision, Roz fires the gun but deliberately misses Battista.\n\nDamian and Roz find themselves locked in a cell together after being captured by security officers. They discuss their differing views on the rebellion and the goals they want to achieve, with Damian eventually admitting that he agrees with Roz's desire for change and justice.

They must avoid Elantian Royal Magicians patrolling the city. Zen uses Light Arts practitioning to leap over city walls and they reach a bamboo forest, where Zen applies a temporary Seal to slow the silver spread on her arm while revealing Lan's strong connection to qì. They head northwest to find a cure for Lan's arm and learn about practitioning, Seals called fú, and meditation's significance in connecting with qì. Lan becomes determined to master practitioning to protect loved ones and learns to summon a supernatural spirit, a yāo, which Zen destroys, warning about demonic practitioning dangers.\n\nIn the Central Plains, Lan and Zen encounter Elantian soldiers and use a Gate Seal to transport themselves to the hidden School of the White Pines in the Skies' End region.

Lan works at Madam Meng's Teahouse but yearns for freedom and control over her life. Her favorite place in the city is Old Wei's Pawn Shop, where she discusses history and gods with Old Wei. Lan's life takes a dramatic turn when she accidentally kills Donnaron, an Elantian soldier, and meets Zen, a practitioner of a forbidden branch of magic bound to the Black Tortoise Demon God.\n\nUnder Zen's guidance, Lan is taken to the School of the White Pines to learn practitioning and uncover the secret hidden within her Seal. At the school, she meets various characters, including Shàn'jūn, a disciple of Medicine, and Dilaya, a disciple of Swords. Lan excels in Seals under the guidance of Master Gyasho. She learns about the history of the Ninety-Nine Clans and the Hin Imperial Court. As Lan trains with Zen, they form a bond of trust, and Zen reveals his own tragic past, including being captured and experimented on by the Elantians during the Conquest. They discuss the concepts of yīn and yáng, which represent the balance and duality of the world and its energies. Grandmaster Dé'zǐ emphasizes the importance of understanding and channeling these energies to become a skilled practitioner.\n\nLan and Zen journey to Guarded Mountain, where Lan hopes to find answers about her mother's Seal and the Elantian magician who has been hunting her. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and dangers, including Elantian soldiers and supernatural spirits. She struggles with her powers and the memories of her mother and her friend Ying, who were both killed by the Winter Magician. At Skies' End, they meet with Grandmaster Dé'zǐ, who explains that the Way is about balance and that both yīn and yáng energies are essential for the world's harmony. He also clarifies that yīn energy, associated with demons, is not inherently evil but rather a natural part of the balance between life and death.\n\nAs Lan continues her training, she overhears a conversation between Shàn'jūn and Tài'gē about the true history of the kingdom, the grandmaster's goals, and the clans. Tài'gē, a former member of the imperial court, reveals that the history of the kingdom has been rewritten, and there is much they do not know. As the story progresses, Lan discovers the ocarina her mother left her, which holds the key to unlocking her mother's mysterious legacy. The ocarina is said to sing for the Ruin of Gods when the time is right, and Lan manages to make it sing by humming a tune that her mother used to play.\n\nLan and Zen face their personal struggles, secrets, and challenges as they journey through the untamed landscape, confronting their pasts and learning to trust in their abilities. As the Elantian army approaches, Lan and the others prepare for battle, while Zen, fueled by anger and the whispers of his Demon God, takes matters into his own hands and stabs Dé'zǐ with his sword. Before passing away, Dé'zǐ reveals several secrets, including Zen's dark heritage, Lan's mission to find the Godslayer, and the existence of the Azure Tiger Demon God at Skies' End.\n\nWith Dé'zǐ's death and Zen's dark nature revealed, Lan and her companions face the invading Elantian army led by Royal Magician Erascius. Lan decides to use the power of her Demon God, the Silver Dragon, to protect her friends and people at Skies' End. However, using this power also risks causing destruction. Realizing the danger, Lan temporarily suppresses the power by stabbing herself with a legendary weapon.\n\nDespite their losses, Lan, Dilaya, and Tai set off on their journey westward to find the Godslayer and other Demon Gods, hoping to destroy them and bring balance to their kingdom against the Elantians. Meanwhile, Zen, who has fully embraced the Black Tortoise Demon God's power, is on a mission to hunt down the other Demon Gods and destroy the Elantian regime. He is accompanied by Shàn'jūn, his once-best friend, whom he is taking care of after Shàn'jūn was injured in battle.\n\nAs they travel, Lan's and Zen's groups confront their inner demons, accepting and renegotiating the terms of their bargains with the powerful beings bound to them. Their objectives clash, as Lan tries to find a way to destroy the Demon Gods and save her kingdom while Zen embraces his dark nature, aiming to bring down the Elantian Empire with the vast power he has acquired.\n\nThe story explores themes of power, destiny, and the balance between good and evil in a world where clans wield the power of Demon Gods, and destiny is dictated by the stars and the land itself. As the characters navigate this treacherous landscape, they must rely on their wits, powers, and each other to protect their kingdom and people from the invading Elantian forces."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:47:23.667396Z","updated_at":"2023-09-22T03:45:16.311888Z","inner_id":10,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":56,"updated_by":5,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6602,"annotations":[{"id":2318,"completed_by":5,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"9EiDOKQX2f","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 1 covers all the main talking points in Summary 2, but it's the latter that dives into more detail.

She has a complicated relationship with Taha, a talented archer and beastseer from a rival clan, who is the son of the Grand Zahim. Amidst their unspoken rivalry, Imani learns that her sister, Amira, has gone missing after chasing down their brother Atheer's stolen horse, Raad. Atheer had disappeared a year earlier, having been caught stealing misra, the source of their magical abilities, from the Sanctuary.\n\nDetermined to save her sister, Imani sets off across the grasslands towards the Forbidden Wastes, a dangerous area filled with evil creatures. She eventually catches up to Amira, whose personality has hardened since Atheer's disappearance. Instead of returning home, the sisters decide to search for Atheer together. They discover an abandoned ancient city called Al-Medina-Al-Uwla, or the First City, within the Vale of Bones. Here, they find clues suggesting Atheer was communicating with outsiders and sharing sacred misra with them. The sisters soon encounter a powerful djinni named Qayn, who claims to have saved Atheer from a suicide attempt and to have been providing him shelter. Qayn reveals that Atheer had been working as a Scout for the Council, secretly venturing across the Swallowing Sands to report on world affairs in the Kingdom of Alqibah, which has been attacked by the Harrowland Empire.\n\nTo gain Qayn's help in finding Atheer, Imani reluctantly binds the djinni to her dagger, despite the act being forbidden. Qayn discloses that Atheer is in the capital city of Taeel-Sa with a group of rebels led by a woman named Farida. Imani, Amira, and Qayn embark on a dangerous journey across the Swallowing Sands towards Alqibah, joined by Taha, Fey, and Reza. During the journey, tensions rise between Imani and Taha, with the latter growing suspicious of Qayn and his connection to Imani.\n\nWhile traversing the lands, Imani learns Harrowtongue, the language spoken in Alqibah, with the help of Taha, who eventually shows a more vulnerable side to her. Despite their rivalry, the pair begin to bond as they face the harsh realities of the mission. In Al-Medina-Al-Uwla, the group inadvertently awakens the giant Hubaal, who threatens to destroy the city. With Qayn's help, they manage to convince the giant to return to sleep, allowing them to continue their mission to find Atheer. As the group gets closer to Taeel-Sa, Imani remains torn between her loyalty to her family and her feelings for Taha. Meanwhile, Qayn's true motives remain unclear.\n\nImani and her companions devise a plan to infiltrate a prison to find Atheer. They mingle with prisoners to gain entry while Qayn, Amira, and Imani's sister Safiya create a distraction. Imani discovers Atheer is a prisoner and reunites with him, but they are soon captured by Taha, who is working for Imani and Atheer's father, Bayek, to kill Atheer for revealing their magic to King Glaedric. Atheer tries to reason with Taha, revealing that he used to be his mentor. Taha eventually relents, throwing down his weapon and agreeing to work with Atheer. Imani reluctantly agrees to cooperate with Taha, and the group moves forward together.\n\nAs they try to escape, they find themselves aboard Farida's ship. Farida, a warship captain and lover of Atheer, urges Imani to join their rebellion to fight the injustices in Alqibah. As they navigate the political landscape of Alqibah, Imani and her friends work together to save her brother and the people of Qalia from the Harrowlanders, who have taken control of the kingdom through economic oppression.

Their journey is filled with dangerous landscapes, encounters with magical beings, and exploration of ancient cities, adding depth to character relationships and Imani's growth.\n\nImani, Atheer, and their newfound allies prepare to confront King Glaedric and his Harrowlander oppressors, using their magical abilities to protect those they love. Despite the high stakes, Imani remains determined to fight for justice in Alqibah and secure her homeland's safety from the Harrowlanders. As the story progresses, Imani faces the consequences of secrets and navigates her loyalty to both her family and Taha, amidst the intrigue of the Kingdom of Alqibah.\n\nIn an ultimate display of their bond, siblings Imani, Atheer, and Amira reflect on the past and their futures aboard Farida's ship as they devise a plan to fight against the injustices in Alqibah. Their commitment to making a difference in the world and strong familial ties are evident throughout their conversation. As they find solace in each other's company, they grow stronger as individuals and as a family, ready to face the challenges that lie ahead in their quest for justice and peace in the world of Qalia.","summary_2":"Imani, a young Shield, learns her missing brother, Atheer, may be alive in the Kingdom of Alqibah, beyond their homeland, the Sahir. Determined to save him and uncover the Council's secrets, she plans to travel there with the help of a djinn named Qayn. Despite tensions with her Auntie Aziza and the Council's Grand Zahim, Bayek, Aziza gifts her a crystal vial containing undying light to guide her journey.\n\nImani leaves at dawn, accompanied by Scouts Taha, Reza, and Fey. They face hostility due to Atheer's situation, traverse the perilous Vale of Bones where monsters lurk, and Taha teaches Imani Harrowtongue to communicate with locals. Reza's appearance changes their relationship, and Imani's horse, Badr, suffers an accident. The group deals with internal struggles and external dangers to save Atheer and learn the truth about their world.\n\nUpon discovering the ancient First City, Amira unexpectedly joins after needing rescue. Their group dynamics shift as they awaken Hubaal, a giant sleeping beneath the city, and turn to Qayn for help escaping. Determined to save Atheer and uncover their people's history, they journey towards Alqibah, facing challenges traversing the treacherous Swallowing Sands guided by Taha. Imani's aunt's gift saves her and Amira as they enter Alqibah, where Qayn's mysterious past and motives add complexity to their journey.\n\nIn Alqibah, they encounter a public execution, emphasizing the harsh realities of their mission. They find Farida, the woman Atheer sought, who reveals he is alive but imprisoned for trying to stop a beating. The group must confront challenges, betrayals, and uncertainties as they devise a plan to pose as prisoners and ambush a prisoner wagon to infiltrate the prison where Atheer is held. Farida provides information on wagon routes, and the group discusses their strategy, relying on their magical abilities to break Atheer out.\n\nSuccessfully posing as prisoners, Imani and her group infiltrate the prison. Despite uncertainties and complex team dynamics, they remain determined to save Atheer and uncover their world's secrets.

She finds out that Zahir, a long-time prisoner, may know Atheer and Fey's whereabouts. Despite watchful guards and the threat of punishment, Imani remains determined to find her brother and escape with her group.\n\nWitnessing suffering and death, the group must balance desperation to save Atheer with their need for self-preservation. Relying on their wits, determination, and the undying light, they seek Atheer in the prison's darkness. Zahir tells them he has been taken to see King Glaedric and is likely on a ship in the Bay. Heartbroken but resolute, they confront Taha's plans to kill Atheer to prevent him from spreading his beliefs in the Sahir.\n\nImani, Amira, and Qayn swim to the king's ship in the Bay, where Atheer is believed to be held. Upon reaching the ship, they encounter conspicuous luxury and spot King Glaedric.

As they plan their escape, Imani is troubled by Qayn's mysterious past and his relationship with Atheer.\n\nThe ship suddenly catches fire, causing chaos on board. Imani realizes Taha and his falcon, Sinan, are responsible. King Glaedric orders an evacuation, and the group is forced onto a boat with several soldiers. As they row away from the burning ship, they are engulfed in darkness, unsure of their bearings and the whereabouts of the other boats.\n\nWith the king's ship sinking and their escape underway, they must now confront the challenges of returning to the Sahir, revealing the truth about their world, and dealing with the consequences of their actions. Amidst chaos and uncertainty, Imani remains determined to protect her family and uncover the secrets that have shaped their lives.\n\nIn the darkness, they are attacked by Farida's ship, led by Taha. Imani manages to disarm Taha, but he refuses to release Amira and Farida, who are held captive by Reza. Atheer tries to reason with Taha, reminding him of their past friendship and urging him to choose a different path. Taha eventually relents, but Imani remains furious with him for his actions and betrayal.\n\nAs the group faces the aftermath of their escape and confronts the consequences of their actions, they must navigate the complex relationships and betrayals that have shaped their journey. With their fates uncertain and their world's secrets still to be uncovered, Imani and her group must decide how to move forward, protect their families, and confront the challenges that await them in the Sahir.\n\nImani tentatively agrees to retrieve Qayn's lost magic in exchange for a magical army to defend the Sahir. She also promises to help Farida fight the Harrowlanders, recognizing that the Sahir's protection is not enough if Alqibah remains in danger. With their newfound alliances and determination to protect all life, Imani and her group prepare to face the challenges that await them as they return to the Sahir, confront the Harrowlanders, and reveal the truth about their world's history and secrets.\n\nThe group shares a moment of relief and happiness as they sit together, reminiscing about their past and discussing their future plans.

Brooke proposes a deal: if Faith investigates Heather's case, Dora, Brooke and Heather's mother, will attend a grief therapy group and clean out Heather's room. Faith's investigation into Heather's disappearance has her connecting with her past and questioning her own family and career choices.\n\nWhen an unexpected visit from Brooke occurs, the two rekindle their bond and discuss their feelings of remorse and loss surrounding Heather's disappearance, as they attempt to bring her story to light and find closure. After a tense encounter with Neil, Faith decides to hold off on her decision about ending the podcast until the completion of the summer. She visits her grandmother at Sparrow's Nest Retirement Village and learns more about the events surrounding Heather's disappearance.\n\nAs Faith prepares to send her daughters off to Hawaii, she grapples with the challenges of investigating Heather's case and the impact it will have on her personal life. Meanwhile, Dora purchases a new smartphone to listen to Faith's podcast and seeks assistance from her granddaughter Charity. Faith returns to Deep Valley, the town where she spent her childhood summers, and reconnects with Dora, who is still waiting for Heather's return. Together, they delve into the past and face their fears as they search for answers about Heather's disappearance and the secrets that have remained hidden for decades.\n\nFaith visits the Deep Valley Police Department and unexpectedly runs into her childhood crush, Nathan Nobbles, now a detective assigned to the Heather Crane case. Despite the awkwardness of their reunion, they agree to meet for lunch to discuss the case. As they reconnect, Faith finds herself confronting her past feelings for Nathan while attempting to uncover the truth about Heather's disappearance. The investigation leads them to face their shared history and the lingering effects of their lost innocence, as they navigate the challenges of moving forward and seeking closure for Heather and the people who have been affected by her absence.\n\nDuring a Fourth of July celebration, Dora makes an effort to connect with her family and show her love for them. Faith assists Dora with preparations and they bond over shared memories. Dora has a vivid vision of her husband Paul, who passed away, sitting beside her as they watch fireworks. The vision is a reminder of their shared past and the pain they've endured, but also serves as a symbol of hope and strength as they continue their search for Heather. In her quest for answers, Faith visits a local hardware store and learns from the owner, Fiona, that there were several shady dealings going on during the summer of Heather's disappearance, including a cover-up at her father's development site. As Faith continues her investigation, she navigates the complexities of her relationships and her past, determined to find the truth about Heather's disappearance and bring closure to all those affected by the tragedy.\n\nFaith's friends Larry and Jean search for and find the green Chevy truck involved in Heather's disappearance, which is submerged in a lake about a hundred miles east of Eugene. Faith and Nathan visit the location and watch as the truck is retrieved from the water. The discovery of the truck could potentially exonerate Mr. Potter of any involvement in Heather's disappearance, as there was not enough time for him to have driven the truck to the lake and returned to Deep Valley by the time he reported it stolen. As they continue to investigate the case, Faith, Nathan, Dora, and the rest of the family grapple with the unresolved emotions and secrets that have haunted them for decades, determined to find closure and justice for Heather and those affected by the tragedy.\n\nDuring their investigation, they learn that Heather likely died due to being struck by a car driven by Harold Walker, who was attempting to silence her after she witnessed him committing a crime. Ivan, Faith's father, was not the one who hurt her, but was involved in disposing of the evidence. Unfortunately, Walker is already dead, which means they'll never be able to bring him to justice. Heather's body is eventually discovered, buried in the center of Deep Valley neighborhood, bringing a measure of closure to her family and friends.\n\nThe discovery of Heather's body helps the family and friends find closure and healing. Dora and Paul find hope for a future together, despite their grief being expressed in different ways. They support each other and look forward to a sweet reunion with Heather when the proper day arrives. Meanwhile, Faith receives a text from Nathan, informing her of a detective job opening in her town, and she encourages him to apply. As she prepares to welcome her daughters back from Hawaii, Faith reflects on the impact of the investigation on her personal life and the importance of love and family.\n\nIn a seemingly unrelated conversation, Cleo discusses with Deacon Tremblay the prospect of breaking into a castle owned by Deacon's family. The castle, called Castle Moreau, was built in the early eighteen hundreds by Deacon's French ancestor, who missed his homeland. The castle retains the original family name, even though Deacon's surname is Tremblay. Cleo, unsure of what she may be getting herself into, finds little comfort in her cat Murphy's presence as she contemplates the situation at hand.\n\nThe story ends with Faith and the others moving forward with their lives, having found closure and justice for Heather and those affected by the tragedy. Cleo's conversation with Deacon about Castle Moreau foreshadows a potential adventure in the next installment of the story, leaving readers curious and eager for more.","summary_2":"In \"What Happens Next,\" author Christina Suzann Nelson tells the story of Faith Byrne, a recently divorced former television news reporter who starts a podcast called What Happens Next, which highlights stories of resilience and positive impacts on the world. After her ex-husband, Neil, takes their daughters, Harlow and Ava, to Hawaii for the summer, Faith receives a letter from Brooke James, the sister of her childhood friend Heather Crane, who went missing in 1987. Brooke asks Faith to look into the case for her podcast. Hesitant but intrigued, Faith decides to investigate Heather's disappearance, as she has fond memories of her friendship with Heather during the summer they spent together in Deep Valley, Oregon.\n\nThe story includes flashbacks to Heather's perspective in 1987 when she meets Faith for the first time, and they form a close bond. However, after Faith moves away, the two lose touch, and Heather is left feeling rejected and abandoned. Faith travels to Deep Valley, staying in her grandmother's old house, and reconnects with her childhood friend Nathan Nobbles, now a detective working on Heather's case. They agree to work together. Meanwhile, Heather's mother, Dora, struggles with her own emotions surrounding Heather's disappearance. Her husband, Paul, has moved out, and her other children, Greg and Brooke, have moved on with their lives. Dora feels abandoned by her family and is determined to keep searching for Heather.\n\nAs Faith delves deeper into the case, she uncovers information about her father, Ivan Ferdon, who was involved in a housing development in Deep Valley at the time of Heather's disappearance. She finds some of her father's belongings in the attic and learns that he may have been involved in some shady dealings. This discovery triggers memories and unresolved grief for Faith, who struggles to come to terms with her father's suicide.\n\nFaith interviews retired Detective Masters about the Heather Crane case and learns more about the investigation at the time. She discovers that Heather had been taking care of a neighbor's cat, Mr. Potter, when she disappeared, and a shirt belonging to her was found in his house. However, there was never enough evidence to arrest him. Mr. Potter's truck was later reported stolen, but the report does not provide much information about it.\n\nFaith continues to uncover clues about Heather's disappearance, including a file from Ivan Ferdon's office found in Heather's room. As she investigates, she must also navigate her complex relationships with her family, including her ex-husband Neil, who threatens to take full custody of their daughters if she puts them in any kind of danger. Faith seeks advice from her friend Kendall and decides to hold off on her decision about ending the podcast until the end of the summer.\n\nThroughout the story, the characters reflect on their past and the relationships they've formed. Nathan recalls having a crush on Faith during their childhood, while Dora remembers how her friendships changed after Heather's disappearance. The story also touches on the challenges and hard work that goes into podcasting, as Faith works on her next episode about Heather's case.\n\nAs the story progresses, it becomes clear that the characters are struggling to come to terms with Heather's disappearance and the impact it has had on their lives. Faith is determined to uncover the truth, while Dora clings to the hope that her daughter could still come home. Paul and Brooke, on the other hand, are trying to find a way to move forward and heal from the pain of their loss.\n\nIn the end, Faith and Nathan, with the help of a rescue diver named Larry, find the green Chevy truck that was involved in Heather's disappearance in a remote location near a lake. They learn that Ivan was not directly responsible for Heather's death, but was involved in the cover-up due to his connection to Harold Walker's crimes. Walker, however, is already dead, making it impossible for him to be arrested and charged for his actions.\n\nDora and Paul receive the news about Heather's fate from Detective Covington and Nathan. They are devastated but find some closure in knowing the truth about their daughter's disappearance and death. Faith returns home to her daughters, Harlow and Ava, who have been staying with their father, Neil. He apologizes for doubting her intentions in investigating Heather's disappearance, and they begin to rebuild their relationship. Faith receives a text from Nate, a detective, informing her of a job opening in her town, and she encourages him to apply."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:47:23.668055Z","updated_at":"2023-09-23T06:41:24.948042Z","inner_id":18,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":56,"updated_by":5,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6610,"annotations":[{"id":2341,"completed_by":5,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"x0gZ0SefJg","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Both summaries are well-written and informative, but Summary 2 is the more detailed and comprehensive one.

Born in the darkness of North Korea during a time of famine, Yeonmi and her mother crossed the frozen Yalu River into China when she was thirteen years old. However, their nightmare continued as they were sold into slavery and subjected to sexual exploitation by human traffickers. Yeonmi's father died from colon cancer shortly after arriving in China, leaving her and her mother to continue their journey alone.\n\nEventually, Yeonmi and her mother found their way to South Korea, where they were introduced to the concept of freedom. Yeonmi became an American citizen in January 2022 and has since dedicated her life to advocating for human rights and exposing the horrors of the North Korean regime. The memoir explores Yeonmi's experiences studying at Columbia University, where she encountered the same oppressive ideologies that had plagued her homeland. Her journey takes her to high-profile events, where she hopes to find support for her cause but is met with sympathy and little concrete help. Disillusioned by the elite's hypocrisy and self-interest, Yeonmi remains determined to raise awareness about the plight of her people.\n\nThe story highlights the importance of individual rights and freedom, drawing inspiration from figures like Thomas Jefferson and Martin Luther King Jr. Yeonmi's story serves as a powerful reminder of the resilience of the human spirit in the face of unimaginable adversity.\n\nOn the American dating scene, Yeonmi meets and marries an American man, and they move to Chicago to give birth to their son. The narrator hopes to teach their son the importance of gratitude, resilience, and happiness in the face of suffering and to be wary of prevailing left-wing ideologies and influences in American society.\n\nYeonmi recognizes the adverse effects of cancel culture in America, compares it to her experiences of censorship in North Korea, and emphasizes the importance of defending individual liberties. Her story also discusses the rise of China as a global superpower and its impact on global politics, including North Korea and the United States. As a victim of human trafficking in China, Yeonmi shines a light on the oppressive nature of the Chinese Communist Party and its impact on the global stage.\n\nThe narrator calls for resistance against the spread of authoritarianism and the importance of preserving the rights enshrined in the Bill of Rights. Yeonmi emphasizes the need for a fifth founding era in America, urging individuals to take charge of their own lives and communities and fostering personal responsibility and local action.\n\nFrustrated with the American education system, Yeonmi worries about the influence Beijing's censorship has on the United States. As she benchmarks her experiences in South Korea and North Korea, Yeonmi urges the American people to resist foreign interference and prioritize the freedoms that the founding fathers fought to protect.\n\nThroughout the journey, Yeonmi faces numerous challenges, including an assault in Chicago in 2020. The incident taught her that many Americans have lost their appreciation for their country's values and are unable to recognize the threats posed by totalitarian ideologies. This realization inspired her to write \"While Time Remains\" as a testament to her experiences and a warning to others about the dangers of complacency in the face of oppression.\n\nYeonmi's memoir is a testament to her remarkable resilience and determination to fight for a better world, free from the darkness she experienced in her early years in North Korea. She draws on her knowledge and experience of North Korea to illuminate the threats to liberty in America and the events of the summer of 2020 that served as motivation for her to write this powerful story.","summary_2":"Yeonmi Park, a North Korean defector, escapes from the brutal regime and survives as a sex slave in China before finding freedom in South Korea and the US. Yeonmi and her mother are sold as \"wives\" to rural Chinese men due to the country's gender imbalance. Despite their ordeal, they are eventually reunited and search for Yeonmi's sister Eunmi, who had also fled North Korea. Yeonmi's father, who was imprisoned in North Korea, rejoins them in China but passes away from colon cancer soon after.\n\nIn South Korea, Yeonmi studies criminal justice, learns English, and participates in a TV show about North Korean defectors, raising her public profile. Her emotional speech at the One Young World conference goes viral, leading to her addressing the United Nations Human Rights Council and obtaining a visa to live in the US. Settling in New York City, Yeonmi begins attending Columbia University to study economics and experiences culture shock as she learns about American concepts of beauty, mental health, and attitudes towards race.\n\nYeonmi faces disappointment at Columbia as the university promotes \"safe spaces\" and discourages critical thinking. Professors and administrators focus on emotional safety rather than intellectual exchange. Yeonmi compares her experiences at the university to North Korean indoctrination and questions the school's commitment to free speech enshrined in the First Amendment. Determined to persevere, Yeonmi acknowledges it will be a long four years at Columbia.\n\nHer activism leads to invitations to high-profile events, including Women in the World hosted by Tina Brown and Jeff Bezos' Campfire event. Initially optimistic about raising awareness of North Korean atrocities, Yeonmi becomes disillusioned by the lack of action from elite attendees, more concerned with their own interests and reputations than the serious issues she raises.\n\nDisillusioned but determined, Yeonmi continues to strive for hope for humanity, justice, and the possibility of making a difference in the world. In her personal life, she finds love, gets married, and, after several attempts with IVF, becomes pregnant. Yeonmi faces the challenges and expectations of motherhood in the US and reflects on the vast differences between her life and those of North Korean mothers.\n\nAs a mother, Yeonmi worries about the impact of leftist ideology on her son's future and education in America. She moves with her husband to Chicago and receives warnings about crime-prone areas. Despite her concerns, Yeonmi remains committed to instilling values of perseverance and resilience in her son while navigating the complexities of American society and politics.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, Yeonmi experiences a violent robbery in Chicago. Bystanders accuse her of racism instead of offering assistance. She reflects on the parallels between North Korean oppression and the growing woke movement in America, both seeking to control thoughts and actions. Yeonmi remains dedicated to fighting for freedom and human rights, drawing on her experiences in both North Korea and the US.\n\nYeonmi faces \"cancel culture\" as she becomes more publicly critical of the Chinese government, including the mistreatment of North Korean women in China. Her speaking engagements at Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and the FBI's field office in Dallas are canceled, allegedly due to her being \"too political\" or controversial. Yeonmi recognizes the potential influence of corporate interests in China on these cancellations and the growing power of cancel culture in stifling free speech in America. She criticizes the Chinese Communist Party's influence and compares cancel culture to dictatorship but remains resolute in her commitment to advocating for human rights and justice.\n\nYeonmi's story highlights the fragility of freedom and the need to preserve it in the face of radical ideologies and external influences. She urges Americans to recognize the importance of their constitutional rights and the potential threat of losing these freedoms to ideologies that undermine societal foundations. Yeonmi embodies perseverance, resilience, and hope for a brighter future committed to justice and human rights.\n\nYeonmi looks up to individuals such as Dr. Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan, who share her values and commitment to free speech. She is also inspired by Candace Owens, an African-American woman who debunks critical race theory and extreme antiracism doctrines. Yeonmi meets Owens at The Daily Wire headquarters in Nashville, where they discuss her life in North Korea, her escape, and the difficulties she endured in China. Yeonmi reflects on the diverse audience applauding her and Owens, seeing it as a representation of America's potential for unity and understanding.\n\nYeonmi's experiences in North Korea, China, and the US have shaped her into a strong advocate for human rights and justice. Through her perseverance and resilience, she continues to fight for freedom and inspire others with her story. As a mother, Yeonmi is committed to instilling these values in her son and ensuring that he grows up with an appreciation for the freedoms and opportunities available in America."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:47:23.668134Z","updated_at":"2023-09-23T07:49:48.319940Z","inner_id":19,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":56,"updated_by":5,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6611,"annotations":[{"id":2340,"completed_by":5,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Yes"]},"id":"f5Ri7SRYIf","from_name":"contradiction","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["In Summary 1, we see Kai gain a mortal body as soon as he wakes up: \"Kai, a disembodied spirit, wakes up in a tomb and inhabits a dying man's body.\" However, in Summary 2, we see he doesn't do this until he's on the Immortal Blessed ship, where \"During their journey, Kai gains a mortal body.\""]},"id":"LStJSZU1jL","from_name":"contradiction_comments","to_name":"summary_1","type":"textarea","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Yes"]},"id":"nG5beCc_6r","from_name":"omission_summary_1","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"12VyoNB18k","from_name":"structure","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"Sjac3oud3D","from_name":"logic","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"rgjXTIOx8W","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 1 contains a lot more information than Summary 2.

He meets a young girl named Sanja, who was to be sacrificed to a powerful sorcerer named Menlas. Kai and Ziede search for their imprisoned friends Tahren, an Immortal Marshall who turned against the oppressive Hierarchs to save her brother Dahin, a Lesser Blessed interested in demons and their abilities, and Dahin to uncover the truth about Kai's imprisonment and the hidden forces working against them. Along the way, Kai and his friends steal an Immortal Blessed ship and head to the Conventiculum of the Immortals at Stios, where they hope to find the finding stones needed to locate Tahren.\n\nDuring their journey, Kai gains a mortal body, named Talamines, which raises questions about his identity among the demon and mortal companions. As they approach the port of Orintukk, they notice the emptiness of the once vibrant city, which had been destroyed by the Hierarchs. They embark on a mission to find a predator in the surrounding forests to help them fight the Hierarchs, but first, interrogate captured cohorts who reveal more information about the political landscape, suggesting that Nient-arik may be undermining Benais-arik and the coalition renewal to become the ruling capital of the Rising World.\n\nKai and his companions, including Ziede, Bashasa, Ramad, Tenes, and Sanja, travel on an Immortal Blessed ascension raft, stopping at a traders' post for supplies. Here, Kai confronts Ramad about his betrayal as Bashat's agent and his involvement in the conspiracy to kidnap Kai, Tahren, and Ziede. Kai informs Ramad that he had already convinced the Enalin provinces to withdraw their support of Benais-arik and Bashat, causing the Imperial renewal to fail and the Rising World to become a coalition of free allies once again.\n\nThe group arrives at the Kagala fortress, which appears to be deserted. However, they spot a Lesser Blessed named Vrenren and some mortals. Dahin, who is piloting the raft, suggests using their Immortal Blessed appearance to deceive Vrenren and his companions. Kai, working with Immortal Marshall Saadrin, infiltrates the fort and rescues Tahren. During their escape, they battle various enemies, including Vrenren.\n\nKai and Bashasa work to rally the Arike people to fight against the oppressive Hierarchs.

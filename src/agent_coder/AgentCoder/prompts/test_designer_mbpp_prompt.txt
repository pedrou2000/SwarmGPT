**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the incomplete function. These test cases should encompass Basic, Edge, and Large Scale scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

**1. Basic Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To verify the fundamental functionality of the `has_close_elements` function under normal conditions.

**2. Edge Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To evaluate the function's behavior under extreme or unusual conditions.

**3. Large Scale Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To assess the functionâ€™s performance and scalability with large data samples.

**Instructions**:
- Implement a comprehensive set of test cases following the guidelines above.
- Ensure each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.
- Pay special attention to edge cases as they often reveal hidden bugs.
- For large-scale tests, focus on the function's efficiency and performance under heavy loads.

- The format of test cases should be:
```python
assert function_name(input) == expected_output, "Test Case Description"
```

# For example:

## Prompt 1:
```python
Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
```

## Completion 1:
```python
assert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))
assert set(similar_elements((1, 2, 3, 4),(5, 4, 3, 7))) == set((3, 4))
assert set(similar_elements((11, 12, 14, 13),(17, 15, 14, 13))) == set((13, 14))
```

## Prompt 2:
```python
Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
```

## Completion 2:
```python
assert is_not_prime(2) == False
assert is_not_prime(10) == True
assert is_not_prime(35) == True
assert is_not_prime(37) == False
```

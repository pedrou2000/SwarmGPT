    "a-fever-in-the-heartland.epub": "The story is set in the 1920s in Indiana, which saw the rise of the Ku Klux Klan under the leadership of D.C. Stephenson. Stephenson was a charismatic but deeply flawed man who inspired fanatical devotion among his followers. Born in Texas to an abusive father, Stephenson moved to Indiana where the white Protestant population was receptive to the Klan's nativist message. He joined the Klan in Evansville in 1921 and quickly rose up the ranks to become Grand Dragon, using intimidation and graft to dominate state politics by the mid-1920s.\n\nUnder Stephenson's leadership, Klan membership grew rapidly in Indiana, peaking at over 250,000. Stephenson attracted members by stoking hatred against Catholics, immigrants and African Americans. He organized elaborate initiation ceremonies with fiery crosses and robes, turning recruitment into spectacle. The Klan presented itself as upholding law and order, though its members participated in beatings and intimidation. Stephenson also had a private vigilante group that conducted violent raids on homes.\n\nThe Klan gained control over Indiana politics, with many officials being Klan members or sympathizers. Stephenson bribed and blackmailed politicians to carry out the Klan's agenda, which included eugenics laws and segregation. He helped elect pro-Klan candidates including Governor Edward Jackson. Stephenson himself aspired to high political office.\n\nHowever, Stephenson's power led to his downfall after he kidnapped, raped, and murdered Madge Oberholtzer, a young woman who worked at the Indiana Statehouse. Oberholtzer managed to identify Stephenson as her attacker before dying from her injuries. Stephenson was put on trial in 1925 in Noblesville, IN. During the sensational trial, the prosecution presented Oberholtzer's dying declaration describing the horrific assault. Despite attempts at intimidation and bribery, Stephenson was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nStephenson's conviction dealt a crushing blow to the Klan's power and legitimacy. Membership declined drastically as scandals emerged revealing the Klan's corruption, violence, and internal dissent. However, the bigoted views championed by the Klan continued influencing state policies well beyond the 1920s. The downfall of the Klan's Grand Dragon demonstrated the danger of allowing predatory and ambitious figures like Stephenson to exploit people's fears and prejudices in seeking power. Ultimately, ordinary citizens must remain vigilant in upholding equality and justice when confronted by demagogues intent on dividing society for their own benefit.",

    "greek-lessons.epub": "The excerpt comes from a larger fragmented narrative exploring a Korean woman's complex relationship with language and emotion after traumatic events have left her unable to speak. The story interweaves the woman's memories from childhood and young adulthood in Germany and Korea with her present experiences as a middle-aged Greek philosophy teacher struggling with muteness. \n\nIn the opening scene, the woman attends a Greek language lesson but is distressed and unable to participate verbally. Through flashbacks, we learn she used to be a literature lecturer and published poet before losing her mother and custody of her eight-year-old son six months prior amidst a painful divorce. Her resulting trauma has triggered her speechlessness. She notices her Greek teacher's facial scar, recalling when she first saw it and thought it marked where tears had flowed. She wonders if her own affliction is similarly inscribed on her face. \n\nThe narrative explores the woman's perspective through memories, dreams, sensory details, and her penchant for poetic rumination. As a child, she was aware of the fragility of existence, having nearly been aborted due to her mother's illness during pregnancy. She recalls vividly experiencing language acquisition. As a teen, she lost the ability to understand language, which returned when a single word inexplicably triggered her memories years later. However, she remains selectively mute, finding speaking and writing intolerable. She studies Ancient Greek's middle voice and rigid grammar as she struggles to regain speech. \n\nAfter losing custody of her young son, the woman walks for hours through Seoul before desperately but silently calling her ex-husband from a phone booth. She sees infinite reflections of her own eyes in the mirror, haunted by old pain. In Greek class, she writes mournful phrases in her notebook, gouging the words onto the page. Her solitary existence is contrasted with glimpses of other characters, like her chatty classmate and a deaf woman who wrote poetry in Greek.\n\nThe story explores the woman's complex relationship with language through the lens of her muteness after trauma. Memories of her German childhood and family surface through her studies of Ancient Greek. The nonlinear narrative style evokes the fragmentation she experiences. Despite her wordlessness, her poetic inner voice and relentless search for meaning persist. The excerpt deploys lyrical language and philosophic musings to convey the profound personal impact of losing one's mother tongue.",

There, she befriended Grace Price, a white widow raising her son Sam, and Fiona Wong, a Chinese woman seeking her missing father. Grace hoped to open a school despite racism towards her students. After Adelaide's family secrets were exposed at a town dance, some locals formed a vigilante \"Stranglers\" group to track her down. Led by Jack Reed, they burned her cabin, forcing her to flee to the mountains seeking her vengeful sister Elizabeth.\n\nIn Big Sandy, Reed's wife Jerrine, leader of a women's group, captured Sam and forced him into servitude as she had once given up her own secret baby. Local youth Joab Mudge, orphaned after Adelaide's demon killed his family for attacking her, became loyal to the powerful Reeds. When Jerrine tried hanging women who had helped Adelaide, Joab turned against the Reeds and freed Sam. Meanwhile, Elizabeth unleashed her fury back in town, massacring many including the Reeds.\n\nAdelaide, Grace, Fiona, and Bertie, a bootlegger, evaded the violence and created their own town called Refuge nearby. Though Adelaide felt responsible for the bloodshed, she realized her own desire for vengeance was also valid after lifetimes of oppression. Women outcasts across the country were drawn to Refuge, growing it from 6 to 65 residents in a secluded valley. Despite enduring trauma and discrimination, the Lone Women found community together. Adelaide and Elizabeth formed a partnership - Elizabeth cared for the children, while Adelaide supported the adults who had faced exclusion. Though left out of mainstream histories, their endurance and collective strength persevered.\n\nThe story features marginalized perspectives often excluded from historical narratives - a black pioneer, a Chinese immigrant, persecuted Native Americans, and white widows and single mothers. Through vivid scenes and moral complexities, it highlights the challenges these diverse women faced building lives, families and communities. Their shared resilience ultimately allowed them to transform hardship into hope.",

    "pathogenesis-a-history-of-the-world-in-eight-plagues.epub": "The story opens with an introduction from the author, Jonathan Kennedy, discussing perspectives on scientific discoveries diminishing human self-importance. Kennedy argues the realization that humans evolved from simpler lifeforms was profoundly humbling. The discovery of microbes and bacteria by Leeuwenhoek further reduced human supremacy. Kennedy asserts the most significant revolution was appreciating the dominance and diversity of microbial life. Bacteria predated animals by over a billion years. Though humans arrived recently, our bodies contain trillions of microbes.\n\nThe story then shifts to discussing Neanderthals, who disappeared around 40,000 years ago as Homo sapiens spread out of Africa. New evidence challenges traditional views of Neanderthals as primitive. Discoveries show they produced art, jewelry, and sophisticated tools, indicating cognitive abilities similar to Homo sapiens. The likely interbreeding between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens further contradicts notions of separate species. Some argue Neanderthals were as intelligent as humans but organised differently, living in small, egalitarian bands.\n\nNext, the story provides background on the Neolithic Revolution when humans transitioned from hunting and gathering to agriculture around 12,000 years ago. This led to booms in population but had negative health impacts as malnutrition and diseases rose. Around 5,000 years ago, Yamnaya steppe herders migrated from the Eurasian steppe into Europe, largely replacing the earlier Neolithic European farmers. It is debated whether Yamnaya conquered Europe violently or primarily spread their culture and language. They brought innovations like wheeled vehicles, horses, and bronze tools. But DNA analysis indicates European ancestry today derives mainly from earlier Neolithic farmers, not the Yamnaya invaders.\n\nThe story then shifts to discussing the transatlantic slave trade starting in the 1500s, which forcibly enslaved over 12 million Africans as European colonists established plantation agriculture in the Americas. The slaves were seen as property to generate wealth for European states and companies engaged in the trade. This commodification of human beings conflicted with Enlightenment ideals of universal rights that otherwise influenced American revolutionaries and French republicans.\n\nFinally, the story examines how recurring plagues shaped European history, contributing to the decline of feudalism, the weakening of the Catholic Church, and the rise of cities and capitalism. In the 1300s, the Black Death killed up to 60% of Europeans, creating labor shortages that increased peasants\u2019 bargaining power against landowners. This undermined the manorial economic system. The Catholic Church also lost standing by proving ineffective against the plague. Dissatisfaction paved the way for later Protestant reformers. Overall, the story covers major themes in human history like scientific discoveries, population migrations, slavery, and disease impacts to provide an overview of key events and forces shaping the modern world.",

    "the-wager-a-tale-of-shipwreck-mutiny-and-murder.epub": "The excerpt comes from a historical narrative that traces the disastrous voyage of the British Royal Navy ship HMS Wager, which sank off the coast of Chile in 1741. The Wager was part of a naval squadron led by Commodore George Anson that embarked from England in 1740 on a secret expedition to raid Spanish settlements along the western coast of South America. This was part of the War of Jenkins' Ear between Britain and Spain. Among the ships in the fleet were Anson's flagship Centurion and the Wager, commanded by Captain David Cheap. The crews totaled around 1900 men, many of them impressed into naval service against their will. \n\nAfter stopping at Madeira, the squadron navigated stormy seas around Cape Horn into the Pacific. However, the ships were battered by violent winds and waves near the Horn. The Wager was damaged and separated from the rest of the fleet. Unable to locate Anson, Captain Cheap wandered for months searching for the Commodore or a place to repair his ship. Sickness spread among the crew. Eventually, Cheap anchored the ailing Wager in a bay on Wager Island off the Chilean coast. There, after months at sea, simmering tensions between the arrogant Captain Cheap and his officers boiled over, causing some of the crew to abandon the wrecked ship. Soon after, during a storm on May 14, 1741, the Wager smashed against rocks and sank, marooning around 140 men on the barren, uninhabited island under Cheap's poor leadership.\n\nOn Wager Island, the men suffered terribly from freezing weather, illness, and shortage of food and shelter. After conflicts over Cheap's incompetence, the carpenter John Cummins led about 20 men in modifying the Wager's damaged longboat into an escape vessel. In September 1741, they sailed the craft north along the Patagonian coast, eventually reaching Spanish settlements in Chile after an arduous two-month journey. The Spanish helped them get to Brazil, from where they sailed back home to England in 1742. \n\nMeanwhile, the other 100+ castaways endured a bleak winter on Wager Island under Cheap's deteriorating leadership. In early 1742, Cheap and about 45 loyal men sailed the newly built sloop Speedwell to Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Island, where three more ships wrecked. After 66 days stranded there, they were rescued by a Spanish ship. However, the Spanish imprisoned Cheap's party for over six months as suspected pirates. They were eventually released and allowed to sail for home. \n\nBack in England, the crew members who returned earlier, including Cummins, faced courts-martial for the loss of the Wager and alleged mutinies. However, the inquiries seemed more concerned with maintaining naval reputations than uncovering facts. Cummins and the others were acquitted with minimal consequence. In the aftermath, Cummins and crewmate John Bulkeley published accounts defending their actions. Meanwhile, Anson persevered across the Pacific with Centurion and returned to England in 1744 with captured Spanish treasure, earning acclaim. But the doomed Wager voyage saw over 200 men lost, revealing the human toll of risky naval expeditions. The disaster left a conflicting legacy in terms of leadership, loyalty, and survival.",

Jen then finds herself travelling to the past, experiencing days out of order as she tries to understand the events leading to the stabbing and change the future. \n\nIn 2003, Jen meets Kelly on their first date at a cafe. Kelly is actually an undercover cop named Ryan infiltrating Jen's father's law firm to investigate his ties to an organized crime ring run by the dangerous Joseph Jones. Ryan falls in love with Jen but maintains his undercover identity as Kelly. When Joseph kidnaps a baby named Eve in 2002 during a car theft, Ryan testifies anonymously against Joseph years later, still concealing his real identity from Jen. After they marry, Ryan becomes Kelly permanently, keeping his past hidden to protect Jen.  \n\nIn the original 2022 timeline, the kidnapped Eve was raised by Joseph's relative and renamed Clio. Todd later meets Clio and they start dating. Jen realizes Kelly has been lying to her and suspects he and Todd are involved in Joseph's criminal network. After seeing Todd stab a man named Joseph, Jen travels to 2003 and gives Ryan information to prevent Eve's kidnapping. This leads to an alternate 2022 where Eve, who was never kidnapped, is now Todd's girlfriend. Though some elements like her father's death remain fixed, Jen's time travel changes the fates of Eve, Todd and Kelly by preventing their involvement with Joseph.\n\nInterspersed are scenes with Ryan in the early 2000s infiltrating Joseph's gang alongside his handler Angela. To maintain cover, Ryan does illegal jobs like delivering stolen cars but is conflicted about crossing moral lines. He wants to save the kidnapped Eve but must build a bigger case against Joseph's operation first. \n\nThroughout her time travelling, Jen discovers lies Kelly/Ryan has told about his identity and childhood. She learns he had criminal ties before becoming an undercover officer. Jen grapples with how little she knows about the man she married. She flits through memories, seeking clues about Kelly/Ryan's past and Todd's motivations that might prevent the stabbing. But the nonlinear events often leave Jen confused and isolated. \n\nUltimately, by travelling to 2003 and tipping off Ryan, Jen sets in motion a chain of events that alters the fates of her loved ones 20 years later. Though the story features many tangled narrative threads, flashbacks, and timeline shifts, Jen's love for her family drives her to unravel the mysteries of the past in order to give them a better future.",
    "yellowface.epub": "The story is told from the perspective of June Hayward, a once successful author who has fallen from grace after being accused of plagiarizing her bestselling novel The Last Front from the unfinished manuscript of her deceased college acquaintance Athena Liu. The story provides background that June and Athena knew each other in college but were never very close. After graduation, their writing careers took different trajectories - Athena found massive success with her debut novel, while June's debut novel was never published when her small publisher folded. \n\nYears later, after Athena's sudden death, June published The Last Front under the pseudonym Juniper Song. The book was a huge success, but June soon faced allegations from literary critic Adele Sparks-Sato and others that she had stolen the story from Athena's unpublished work. At first June denied it, but the accusations persisted. It was eventually revealed that parts of June's new book Mother Witch were copied directly from Athena's writing. Overwhelmed by the public backlash, June isolated herself and began abusing substances. She became determined to rebuild her reputation by writing her side of the story.\n\nJune started work on a fictionalized memoir about her complex relationship with Athena. She described their early friendship souring over jealousy about their divergent careers. In college, Athena had stolen a story based on June's traumatic experience at a party. June's new manuscript would blend fact and fiction about Athena as revenge. She excitedly posted about it on social media, but was then bizarrely taunted by Athena's old Instagram account suggesting Athena was alive. \n\nObsessed with figuring out who was behind the account, June discovered Athena's ex-boyfriend Geoff was not involved. She then met a former publishing assistant named Candice who admitted to impersonating Athena online to torment June. Candice revealed she had evidence of June confessing to stealing Athena's work. After a violent confrontation at a memorial event for Athena, June was hospitalized, but remained determined to fight back against Candice's efforts to expose her as a plagiarist. \n\nThe story provides insight into the ruthless world of publishing through June's desperate efforts to preserve her career. Despite achieving success through unethical actions, June refuses to take accountability. She is haunted by Athena's memory and the forms it takes through taunting social media accounts, visions of Athena's \"ghost,\" and finally the vengeful Candice seeking justice for Athena's stolen work. The excerpts depict June's unraveling grip on reality as she attempts to maintain her public persona and keep her misdeeds hidden at all costs. Though June achieves short-term victories in diminishing her critics, she remains unable to resolve the core dilemma of building a career on deceit."

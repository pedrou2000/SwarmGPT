Given a book summary and a sentence from that summary, determine if that sentence causes any confusion. Types of confusion include the following:

- Entity omission: an entity, real or abstract (person, object, place, concept, etc.) is mentioned, but key details are missing or unclear
- Event omission: an event is mentioned, but key details are missing or unclear
- Causal omission: the reason or motivation for something is missing or unclear
- Salience: inclusion of trivial details that do not contribute to the main storyline
- Discontinuity: an interruption in the flow of the narrative, including but not restricted to: sudden jumps between perspectives, time periods, or settings; poor transition between sentences or paragraphs; sentences or paragraphs that seem out of place; illogical sentence order or summary structure
- Duplication: redundant repetition of similar information
- Inconsistency: two parts of the summary contain contradicting information
- Language: grammar issues; confusing wording or phrasing; etc.

For something to qualify as a confusion, it must meet these two conditions:

1. Without resolving the confusion, readers would struggle substantially to grasp the main narrative, or the summary would appear incoherent.
2. The confusion can't be resolved solely using the information provided in the summary.

If the given sentence involves confusion that meets these two qualifications, ask relevant clarifying questions and provide the confusion types. There can be multiple questions, and keep in mind that a sentence may involve multiple types of confusion. If the given sentence doesn't involve any confusion, simply say "no confusion". Some examples are provided below, followed by the summary and sentence that you need to annotate.

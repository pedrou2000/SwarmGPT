Given a book summary and sentences from that summary, determine if those sentences cause any confusion. Types of confusion include the following:

- Entity omission: an entity, real or abstract (person, object, place, concept, etc.) is mentioned, but key details are missing or unclear
- Event omission: an event is mentioned, but key details are missing or unclear
- Causal omission: the reason or motivation for something is missing or unclear
- Salience: inclusion of trivial details that do not contribute to the main storyline
- Discontinuity: an interruption in the flow of the narrative, including but not restricted to: sudden jumps between perspectives, time periods, or settings; poor transition between sentences or paragraphs; sentences or paragraphs that seem out of place; illogical sentence order or summary structure
- Duplication: redundant repetition of similar information
- Inconsistency: two parts of the summary contain contradicting information
- Language: grammar issues; confusing wording or phrasing; etc.

For something to qualify as a confusion, it must meet these two conditions:

1. Without resolving the confusion, readers would struggle substantially to grasp the main narrative, or the summary would appear incoherent.
2. The confusion can't be resolved solely using the information provided in the summary.

If the given sentences involve confusion that meets these two qualifications, ask relevant clarifying questions and provide the confusion types. There can be multiple questions, and keep in mind that a sentence may involve multiple types of confusion. If the given sentences do not involve any confusion, simply put null as questions and types. Some examples are provided below, followed by the summary and sentences that you need to annotate.

Answer with a JSON list as in examples below.

In the small town of Elm Avenue, teenage twins Aida and Salma are inseparable. When Aida mysteriously disappears, Salma recounts their childhood and the search for her sister begins. Sightings of Aida surface, but each time, witnesses mistake Salma for her missing twin. As the search continues, their parents' strained relationship is revealed, as well as Aida's secret relationship with a boy named Marlon. Despite their mother's obsession with Marlon as a suspect, he is cleared when numerous sightings of Aida appear across the country. A hiker eventually discovers Aida's boots, which leads to the sad conclusion that Aida has died. The family holds a private funeral for her, and the story explores the emotional impact of her disappearance and death.

Meanwhile, the focus shifts to a new character, Fausto, and his relationship with Paz, as they navigate life in a hurricane-ravaged Miami neighborhood. Fausto and Paz become involved in illegal activities, running drugs for a man named Anibal. Fausto convinces Paz to continue their dangerous lifestyle with the promise of a better future together. Tensions rise as their actions put them at odds with Paz's father, Silvio, and Fausto's family. The story also introduces a character named Padre Miguelangel, who becomes involved in the couple's drug-running activities by accepting their dirty money for the church. As Fausto's criminal life catches up to him, he flees to Colombia, leaving Paz behind with the drug money and a heavy heart.

In Colombia, Fausto meets a woman through a matchmaking agency, and they begin a relationship that leads to marriage.

Vladi aspires to be a writer but struggles with writer's block. Natasha's mother receives an offer from the government to buy their property, and she decides to use the money to send Natasha and Vladi to the United States. The couple must now confront their feelings for each other and the challenges of leaving their home country. Through it all, their love for their daughter keeps the couple together, even as they face their individual struggles and conflicts. As Vladi's relationship with both Natasha and Lily deepens, he questions his feelings for each of them, leading to a complicated love triangle. As their departure to the United States nears, Vladi wrestles with the decision of whether to be open about his feelings for Lily or to commit to Natasha.

[Example summary 2]

Proctor Bennett, a ferryman in Prospera, assists people transitioning to new lives upon retirement. Struggling with dreams and discontent, his wife Elise suggests a change in his work. He meets a young girl named Caeli and forms a bond with her. Proctor is assigned the retirement of his estranged father and discovers a boat his father built as a tribute to Proctor's late mother, Cynthia. His father panics and flees, resulting in a chaotic chase on the pier.

Deciding to quit being a ferryman, Proctor teaches Caeli how to swim. Proctor's superior, Amos Cordell, submits an incident report for his father's retirement. A mysterious man introduces Proctor to "Arrivalism." He learns that their old friend Warren, a medic, will join him and Elise for a concert. Uncertain about Warren's intentions, Proctor's future remains unclear.

At the concert, Proctor meets Thea Dimopolous, an intriguing woman, and they flirt. However, he returns to Elise, adding tension to his uncertain future. Proctor discovers that Otto Winspear, from the State Security Service, interrogates his trainee, Jason Kim. Proctor seeks answers from his mother-in-law, Callista, about the investigation. Proctor and Jason visit his father's house, finding Proctor's old empty room and evidence of a recent paint job.

Amos and Nabil West inform Proctor that the watchman he assaulted on the wharf has died, and Proctor is considered responsible. Jason Kim, his trainee, provides evidence against him. Proctor's life becomes more uncertain as he and Thea discover that Caeli seemingly does not exist. He faces consequences as his marriage struggles and his connection to Thea deepens.

During a mission to find Caeli, Proctor is captured by watchmen while Thea escapes. Amidst chaos, Proctor experiences strange dreams and finds himself in a house where he weeps into a dress with a storm raging outside. Thea and an unknown man rescue him, hiding in a cabin where Thea watches over Proctor. He discovers that his health is failing, with a 9% life expectancy. Desperate, Proctor removes the monitor from his body, risking injury. With Thea's help, he survives but remains determined to find Caeli.

Proctor ends up in a facility known as the Nursery. Intent on finding answers, he navigates challenges and deceptions in the Nursery. Aurelia Voss recognizes Proctor, and he finds a map that may unravel the mysteries of the facility.

Rescued by Thea and Stefano, Proctor reunites with his mother, Cynthia, who he thought was dead. She reveals her involvement with the Arrivalist movement and that she faked her death for her work. She explains that Proctor's father also knew and worked with the movement. Proctor confronts his past and relationships while navigating the hidden Annex underground resistance network. He confronts Otto, learning that Elise is on her way to an "exciting new life" with Warren.

During a car chase, Proctor's life is turned upside down. His search for Caeli leads him to Elise, who is experiencing strange dreams. Proctor and Thea believe Elise's dreams are the key to finding Caeli, setting out to uncover the truth. They must confront the true nature of their world as Proctor finds himself in a war, determined to reach Elise, who is caught in the chaos.

Proctor is shot multiple times by Otto, who takes Elise hostage. As he lies dying, he hears Cynthia shoot at Otto. Proctor clings to hope, believing that he has found Caeli when Elise calls out her name. As the dream world dissolves, Cynthia comforts Proctor, accepting his fate.

As the colonists prepare to leave, Proctor decides to stay behind and care for the remaining investors in stasis. Despite protests, he remains determined to fulfill his duty. In a farewell, Proctor marries his brother Malcolm to Cynthia and says goodbye to his loved ones. As the boat departs, Proctor is alone with his uncertain future.

In the new settlement, Thea adjusts to her life, working hard and finding solace in nature. She meets Pappi, a fellow colonist, and they discuss their experiences and the mysteries of the planet. The colonists find purpose in their new lives on the alien world. Proctor, now an academy director, deals with students and school issues, seeking help from Callista to fund a roof replacement.

Proctor returns home and finds Elise working in her backyard studio. They discuss their daughter's whereabouts and their plans for the evening. They prepare to celebrate their daughter Caeli's eighth birthday, enjoying dinner, cake, and presents before going sailing at Caeli's request. They return home, and Proctor tucks Caeli in, reminiscing about the day and wishing her a happy birthday.

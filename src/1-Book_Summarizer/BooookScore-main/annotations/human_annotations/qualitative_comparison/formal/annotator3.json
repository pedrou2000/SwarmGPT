Will's estranged wife, Chris, an industrial diver, leads a rescue team on the surface, determined to save the passengers, including her family. As the passengers run out of air and are at risk of dying from exposure, Chris devises a risky plan to save them by attaching a rescue module called the Falcon to the plane.\n\nThe rescue team, led by Fitz, initially decides on using SEIE suits to help the passengers escape, but after a tragic accident involving a passenger named Andy, the plan is abandoned. The passengers unanimously vote against using the SEIE suits, putting their trust in Chris's alternative plan. This plan involves stabilizing the plane by dropping its tail, which will cause the air pocket inside the plane to become smaller. As the air quality worsens, the survivors begin to use oxygen bottles to stay ahead of carbon dioxide poisoning.\n\nDuring a phone call, Chris and Will discuss their daughter Shannon and how the loss of their other daughter, Annie, affected their family. They both apologize for their shortcomings during that time and express their love for Shannon. This conversation helps them reconnect and become a family again. As the rescue mission gets underway, the survivors inside the plane struggle to adapt to their new reality. They must learn to tread water and spread out along the aisle to access the remaining air. As they brace themselves for the difficult task ahead, they put their trust in the rescue team to save them from their dire situation.\n\nThe passengers, including Shannon, Maia, Ruth, Ryan, Bernadette, Jasmine, and Molly, prepare to escape into the Falcon. However, a massive wave hits the ship, causing the rescue module to tip and the passengers to fall back into the water. The ship's crew, including Chris, Noah, and Sayid, scramble to free the Falcon from the sinking plane. They work frantically to cut through the metal attachments holding the module to the plane as the ship's cable begins to snap and the plane starts to fall into the abyss. Ruth, unwilling to leave the sinking plane, decides to stay behind and swim deeper into the wreckage. Despite Kit's desperate attempts to save her, Ruth insists that it is her choice to stay with the plane and her deceased husband, Ira.\n\nFinally, Chris manages to free the Falcon from the plane, but no one can hear her pleas to bring the module up to the surface. As the Falcon continues to sink, the passengers inside fear for their lives and wonder what will kill them first - the lack of air, the crushing pressure, or being stranded on a shelf too deep for rescue. Sayid, still searching for Chris and the Falcon, notices the irregular flashing of her torchlight and realizes it's a signal. The divers must now race against time to save the passengers and reunite with Chris before it's too late.\n\nAs Chris and her team work tirelessly to free the passengers, the Falcon suddenly starts moving upwards, and the trapped passengers are brought to the surface. However, Chris's relief is short-lived when the cable of her cutting torch snaps, and she is electrocuted by a jagged metal edge. Her teammates, Sayid and Noah, find her unresponsive and desperately try to bring her to the surface.\n\nMeanwhile, the passengers are safely brought aboard the rescue ship, the Powell. Will anxiously searches for his wife, only to learn that she has been taken to a hospital in Honolulu. Despite being weak and needing medical attention himself, Will demands to be taken to the hospital to see Chris. Fitz promises Will that he will be informed of any updates about Chris's condition. As Will and Shannon are taken to a recompression chamber for treatment, Fitz tells Will that he and Chris were right about everything, and their actions saved the lives of the passengers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crash, the survivors gather around a fire on the beach, reminiscing and sharing the goodbye letters they had written while stranded. They find comfort and closure in sharing these letters, acknowledging the love and gratitude they all felt during their ordeal. A year later, Will and Shannon return home after attending a ceremony commemorating the crash. Shannon admits to feeling guilty for being glad the crash happened, as it brought Will back into her life. Will finds solace in a note he had written during their time stranded, promising to tell Chris about it later.\n\nThe story highlights the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity and the importance of finding joy and hope even in the most dire circumstances. It also emphasizes the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and the bond between Chris and her team, who are like a family. Despite the challenges they face, they continue to fight for survival and the safety of the passengers they are trying to save.","summary_2":"Will Kent and his daughter Shannon are aboard Coastal Flight 1421 when an engine explodes, causing chaos onboard. Pilots Kit Callahan and Captain Miller struggle to regain control and ultimately decide to prepare for a water landing. Passengers brace for impact, fearing the worst, but the plane lands relatively intact. Survivors scramble to evacuate as flight attendants Molly and Colleen try to maintain order and nurse Bernadette assists with injured passengers. Will focuses on keeping Shannon safe during the ordeal. As fire engulfs the water's surface, Will convinces Kit and others to stay on the sinking plane, believing it's their only chance of survival.\n\nThe plane begins to sink, but the water stops rising, giving passengers temporary relief. However, they realize they are trapped with no way to escape. Tensions rise as they blame each other and face the reality that they may die trapped. Meanwhile, a water-activated emergency locator transmitter is set off, providing hope for rescue.\n\nIn a flashback, Will's strained relationship with his wife Chris after their other daughter Annie's death is revealed. Their marriage deteriorates as they struggle to cope and support Shannon, who feels stifled by her father's overprotectiveness. Chris urges Shannon to talk to Will about her feelings during their flight. The twelve remaining survivors, including Will, Shannon, Kit, Kaholo, Molly, Bernadette, and several passengers, wait for help to arrive.\n\nUnaware of the crash, Chris, a skilled underwater welder, works with her diving partner Peter Feeny. They later learn about the situation and watch the news, hoping to see Shannon or Will. Chris vows to save anyone still alive and learns about a possible rescue plan involving the Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System (SRDRS), specifically the pressurized rescue module called the Falcon.\n\nAs the trapped passengers struggle to find solutions, Shannon has an allergic reaction to peanuts. Will frantically searches for her EpiPen, while Kit remembers an air-to-ground phone and hopes to contact a doctor for advice. Meanwhile, Chris, determined to save her family and the other passengers, proposes to modify the Falcon to adapt it to the trapped plane. Despite facing resistance, she convinces authorities to let her help with the rescue mission.\n\nThe trapped passengers try to stay hopeful and pass the time. Kit connects with Fitz, a rescue leader working with Chris, via the air-to-ground phone. Fitz assures Kit that they're doing everything to save the passengers. The divers, led by Tanner, begin their dangerous mission to rescue the trapped passengers. As they start drilling, Tanner catches a glimpse of the little girls inside the plane and realizes the gravity of the situation. However, as the drilling continues, the plane becomes unstable, and Fitz orders the divers to stop. One of the divers, Runt, is lost during the chaos, causing tensions to rise further.\n\nWill suggests taking the plane apart to allow access to the aluminum outer skin if they implement Chris's plan. Despite the risks, the passengers acknowledge that there is no safe way out and must trust the rescue mission. Kaholo, a flight attendant, volunteers to try the SEIE suits provided by the divers as a means of escape. Everyone argues and doubts the plan, but Kaholo insists on trying, promising to report back. Kaholo's ascent is successful, giving hope to the ongoing rescue efforts.\n\nAs the rescue continues, Will, Kit, and Ruth struggle to get Ruth out of the plane before ultimately succeeding. The passengers work together to get everyone into the Falcon while dealing with limited oxygen and rising water levels. Molly becomes trapped underwater but is saved by Jasmine and Bernadette.\n\nDuring the rescue process, the plane becomes unstable, and the Falcon begins to sink. Chris, determined to save the passengers, works on cutting the final attachment to free the Falcon. Unbeknownst to her, her communication line is cut, and no one can hear her updates. The passengers inside the Falcon, including Will and Shannon, wonder what will happen to them as they continue to sink. In a desperate attempt to signal other divers, Chris uses her torch, hoping someone will understand and help them.\n\nThe rescue mission continues as the remaining passengers and rescuers hope that they can all make it out alive. Chris cuts the Falcon free, but her electrical line is severed, causing her to receive an electric jolt and lose consciousness. Divers Sayid and Noah rescue her and bring her to the surface, but she remains unresponsive. Chris is airlifted to a hospital in Honolulu, and Sayid and Noah are also taken for treatment.\n\nAs the Falcon is hoisted onto the deck of the rescue ship, the passengers are reunited with their loved ones and receive medical attention. Will, desperate to see his wife, demands a helicopter to take him to the hospital, but he is urged to prioritize his own health and Shannon's. Fitz promises to keep Will updated on Chris's condition and acknowledges that Will and Chris were right about the rescue plan.\n\nThe story showcases the bravery, determination, and selflessness of everyone involved in this life-threatening ordeal. As the survivors receive treatment and begin to process their harrowing experience, they are left to hope for the best for Chris and their own futures. One year later, the survivors who were on Flight 1421 gather for a ceremony and share their feelings, regrets, and gratitude. Will and Shannon return home and discuss the events with Chris, who has recovered and is back with her family. The impact of the crash has forever changed the lives of everyone involved, but they find solace in the love and bonds they have formed through their shared experience."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:49:07.901521Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T02:22:46.647872Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":58,"updated_by":7,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6633,"annotations":[{"id":2294,"completed_by":7,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"V4FaxdaPrg","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Yes"]},"id":"O_xPIOQuAL","from_name":"omission_summary_1","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"X2WHvnxNMY","from_name":"logic","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"Q0WSgHc8OI","from_name":"structure","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"HtPvIgILLQ","from_name":"preference","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Much of the magical stuff that happens is Summary 2 really helps motivate the story.

She rents a cottage from a local farmer, Krystjan Egilson, and his son Finn, who helps her with basic necessities and provides information about the local area. Emily encounters various challenges and obstacles in her quest to study the enigmatic species of faerie called the \"Hidden Ones,\" navigating the harsh weather, the remote location, and the skepticism of the local villagers.\n\nDuring her stay, Emily receives a letter from her colleague and rival, Dr. Wendell Bambleby, a prominent dryadologist at Cambridge, who expresses concern for her safety and hints at possibly joining her in Ljosland. Wendell unexpectedly arrives unannounced with a group of students and a large amount of luggage. Emily is initially annoyed, but Wendell explains that he is there to assist her and offers to present their findings together at the prestigious International Conference of Dryadology and Experimental Folklore (ICODEF) in Paris. Despite her reservations, Emily agrees to the arrangement, realizing that it could greatly benefit her career.\n\nAs they settle in, Wendell charms their host, Krystjan, with his fluency in Ljoslander and offers to cook a meal for Krystjan's family as a token of appreciation. Throughout their stay, Emily's thoughts and observations reveal her suspicions about Wendell's true nature, believing him to be a faerie due to his uncanny abilities and changeable emotions. Despite her doubts, she finds herself drawn to him, as he represents a piece of her life in Cambridge.\n\nEmily and Wendell venture into the surrounding forests and mountains, searching for signs of the Folk and their habitats. They discover a hot spring with wooden figurines and rock caramels, indicating that the area is frequented by the Folk. Emily leaves an offering of Turkish delights and a diamond to introduce herself to the local faeries. During her exploration, she reflects on her past and her fascination with faeries, which began during her childhood when she read every book in her grandfather's library about the Folk.\n\nAs they delve deeper into the world of the faerie folk, Emily and Wendell uncover secrets and mysteries that change their understanding of the world and their place in it. Wendell reveals that he is a faerie prince in exile, seeking a way back to his kingdom. Emily offers to help him in his search, driven by her own intellectual curiosity and desire to explore the unknown. Together, they face numerous challenges and adventures, including battling dangerous faeries and rescuing enchanted villagers, all while trying to maintain their own safety and well-being.\n\nEmily is visited by Lilja and Margret, two girls she had previously rescued from the Hidden Ones' fair. They invite Emily to join them for some wine, but she declines, preferring to stay and practice her wood chopping skills. Throughout their interactions, Emily is puzzled by Wendell's secretive behavior, as he continues to search for a door to his faerie realm without enlisting her help. She also notices the way he looks at her and wonders if there is something more to their relationship.\n\nEmily and Wendell continue their investigation into the changeling problem in Hrafnsvik. They visit the changeling's foster parents, Aslaug and Mord, to try and learn the changeling's true name. Upon entering the room, the changeling sends a pack of snarling white wolves at them, but they are determined to learn his true name and put an end to the village's suffering.\n\nIn a later part of the story, Emily finds herself trapped in the faerie king's ice palace, where she is forced to marry him. The king has caused an unusually harsh winter in Ljosland, and Emily is concerned about the mortal villages that will suffer. Wendell, disguised as a faerie tailor, visits her and tells her about the plan to rescue her and end the king's reign. Wendell reveals that he has been working with the villagers of Hrafnsvik, who are determined to save Emily despite her initial belief that they would not care about her fate.\n\nThe villagers try various methods, including poisoning the king during a gift-giving ceremony, to rescue Emily. However, when the moment comes for her to pass the poisoned wine to the king, she hesitates, feeling that the murder would bring ruin to all involved. Instead, her friend Aud intervenes, knocking the glass from Emily's hand and claiming that the wine had been poisoned by allies of the former queen. The chaos that follows allows Emily and her friends, Wendell, Aud, Aslaug, and Finn, to flee the palace.\n\nEmily and Wendell return to Paris to present their findings at the ICODEF conference. Wendell has written a paper using Emily's notes on faeries, and she is impressed with his work. The story ends with Emily and Wendell preparing to leave for a conference, their relationship deepened by their shared experiences and passion for the study of the Folk.","summary_2":"Professor Emily Wilde, a faerie researcher, and her dog Shadow arrive in the isolated village of Hrafnsvik, Ljosland, to study local faeries in the Karrðarskogur forest and surrounding mountains. At the village tavern, she meets headwoman Aud and learns about the villagers' experiences with faeries from a young woman named Auður. Determined to clear up misunderstandings about the faeries, Emily proceeds with her research, despite Aud's request not to include Auður's experiences.\n\nDuring her research, Emily discovers a diamond, which she believes is a faerie sign. She bargains with a faerie for food and later finds her cottage in disarray after sheep invade it. Amidst the chaos, Dr. Wendell Bambleby, a fellow scholar, arrives unexpectedly with two students, leading Emily to question his presence.\n\nBambleby reveals he is there to assist Emily in her research and proposes they present their findings together at a prestigious conference in Paris. She reluctantly agrees, knowing it could advance her career. As they work together, Emily discovers Bambleby is a faerie prince, raising questions about his intentions.\n\nTheir collaboration is marked by misunderstandings and disagreements, and the students who accompanied Bambleby disappear. Emily and Bambleby embark on an expedition to find a mysterious white tree connected to the faeries. They follow a trail left by two abducted villagers, Lilja and Margret, facing challenges and dangers in the faerie world.\n\nDuring their journey, bogle faeries attack Emily, and she calls for Bambleby's help. He arrives in a fury, killing the faeries. Emily decides to accept Bambleby's faerie nature and work with him to complete their mission and save the missing girls. In the end, Bambleby uses his powers to heal Margret, leaving a scar of snowflakes on her face, and they make their escape.\n\nBefore they leave, a faerie with an enchanted sword attacks Bambleby, who manipulates time to catch the sword. He defends himself and Emily with a sword made from her tears, similar to a story from his realm. After defeating the attacker, they return to Hrafnsvik, where Bambleby's true identity is revealed to the village. They continue their research and plan to present their findings, including a mysterious white cloak, at the conference.\n\nEmily and Bambleby's friendship deepens as they navigate village suspicions, and Emily bonds with Lilja and Margret. She decides to discover the name of a changeling creature she previously encountered, believing it could help her research and protect the village. She enlists Bambleby's help to confront the changeling, bringing a token from its home to compel it to reveal its name.\n\nAs Emily navigates the faerie realm, she breaks an enchantment and cuts off her finger to free a hidden king trapped in a tree. The king intends to marry Emily, forcing her to face the potential impact on her research, her relationship with Bambleby, and the village's future. The king sends craftspeople and servants to prepare for their wedding, but Emily resists the idea. She tries to escape the faerie palace but is thwarted by enchantments and her disoriented state.\n\nEmily learns that Bambleby has disguised himself as an oíche sidhe tailor to help her, along with Shadow. The village is also working to rescue her, knowing she saved three of their children from the faeries. However, she must find a way to achieve her freedom and undo the damage caused by the faerie king's eternal winter on the village. With Bambleby's help, Emily continues her search for answers and attempts to escape the faerie realm, while protecting those around her.\n\nEmily attends the king's gift-giving ceremony, receiving a pair of shoes from Wendell that warm her feet and bring a sense of spring. Villagers Aud, Finn, and Aslaug attend, presenting the king with a bottle of honey wine as a gift. This gives Emily hope that she is not alone in her struggle.\n\nEmily and Wendell thwart a plot to poison the king by spilling the poisoned wine, causing chaos at the palace. They escape with the help of Aud, Finn, and Aslaug, who remain loyal to Emily. Wendell guides them through various enchantments, leading them to safety down the mountainside. They journey back to Hrafnsvik, uncertain and dangerous.\n\nBack in Hrafnsvik, Emily and Wendell prepare to leave for the conference in Paris, with the entire village coming to see them off. They exchange goodbyes and thank-yous with the villagers, who have come to accept their friendship and Bambleby's true identity. As they board the ship, Emily reflects on the bonds she has formed with the villagers and the impact of her experiences in the faerie realm. Despite the challenges and dangers they have faced, Emily and Wendell remain determined to present their findings and continue their research together.\n\nAt the conference, Emily and Wendell create a stir with their presentation, which includes remnants of the faerie cloak, a necklace of ice chains, and a jagged spire of volcanic rock with a tiny wooden door that vanishes in direct sunlight. Wendell jokingly suggests that if Emily had accepted his marriage proposal, they could have introduced her as Mrs. Wendell Bambleby and caused even more of a sensation. Emily teases him about his appearance, and they share a moment of camaraderie before stepping onto the stage to share their discoveries with the scholarly world."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:49:07.901694Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T16:49:04.946438Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":58,"updated_by":7,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6634,"annotations":[{"id":2295,"completed_by":7,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"CFUnKmPcJ5","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 1 explains WHY Song Yan visits Nini in more detail, where it says, \"In an attempt to confront her frustrations and seek solace, Song Yan visits her best friend Nini, who provides her with comfort and a sense of stability.\" Summary 1 gets into more details about Bai Yu's invitation to Song Yan, where it says, \"Curious and intrigued, Song Yan considers whether to accept the invitation and learn more about the sender of the mysterious mushrooms,\""]},"id":"6NpWZmYhWs","from_name":"detail_comments","to_name":"summary_1","type":"textarea","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"oxur_EWNt9","from_name":"structure","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"d_ySPiJ-JK","from_name":"logic","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"Bud1LtJG5-","from_name":"contradiction","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["No"]},"id":"fgb09A8C8s","from_name":"omission_summary_1","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Yes"]},"id":"PFm7aX36hD","from_name":"omission_summary_2","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"Tzxd1WIHl8","from_name":"preference","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 1 gives more background as to why things are happening.

She has experienced significant personal loss, including the death of her mother, a divorce, and losing custody of her son. Despite these hardships, she does not attribute her speech disorder to these events. The woman's fascination with language began at a young age when she taught herself Hangul, the Korean alphabet. As she grew older, her love for language intensified, but her relationship with language became increasingly painful and overwhelming, causing her to lose her ability to speak and understand language for the first time when she was sixteen.\n\nIn an attempt to reconnect with language, the woman attends Ancient Greek lessons at a private academy. The teacher is a man in his mid to late thirties with a scar on his face and poor eyesight, who is gradually losing his vision. The other students in the class include a baby-faced university student, a middle-aged man, and a well-built young man. The protagonist struggles to participate in the class, unable to read out loud or communicate with her classmates.\n\nThe protagonist is a mother to a young son, whom she is only allowed to see for one night every two weeks. Her son informs her that he will be sent to live with his father's sister in another country for a year, and he pleads with her to talk to his father about letting him stay. She lives in a flat filled with the child's belongings and memories, refusing to put them away in hopes of regaining custody. She occasionally sits on the step inside her front door, remembering the sensation of her tears and the words that used to flow from her.\n\nAs the story progresses, the woman's memories and experiences intertwine with those of the Greek teacher. The teacher shares his own experiences and fears, such as his difficulty in seeing and his terror of speaking. He also reflects on his past relationships, particularly his connection with a deaf woman who spent her time making wooden furniture in a workshop at the back of a hospital. Despite their individual disabilities, the woman and the teacher form an unlikely bond, demonstrating the power of human connection and understanding in the face of adversity.\n\nThe woman also recalls a time when she was fifteen and had to leave Korea with her family. She bought several books on Buddhism, including one by Borges, which she read repeatedly during her seventeen years in Germany. The books helped her remember the moon and the lanterns from her time in Korea, and she developed a deep connection with the Hwaeom Sutra Lectures.\n\nThroughout the story, the woman grapples with her muteness and the complexities of language. She is haunted by her past experiences and her fragile existence, as well as her love for the man whose voice she has never heard. Her journey highlights the challenges of communication and the importance of finding one's own voice in a world filled with noise.\n\nAs the man's vision worsens, he moves back to Seoul, where he teaches Ancient Greek at a private academy. He spends his days observing the people around him, using his imagination to fill in the details he can no longer see. The man also contemplates the nature of love and loss, questioning whether his love for the deaf woman was foolish or if it was love itself that made him foolish.\n\nThe story ends with the woman and the man attempting to help a bird that is trapped in a building, connecting their present experience to the memories and emotions evoked by the people they've loved and lost. The story explores themes of loss, personal struggle, the power of language, and the importance of human connection. Through their study of Ancient Greek and their shared experiences, the woman and the teacher hope to find a way to break the silence that has enveloped their lives and regain their connection to the world through language."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:49:07.901981Z","updated_at":"2023-09-20T17:52:20.372917Z","inner_id":5,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":58,"updated_by":7,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6637,"annotations":[{"id":2303,"completed_by":7,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"yeJnNqgT0A","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"By8eW5o5J0","from_name":"structure","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 2 feels all over the place a bit.

After making adjustments to the positions of the musicians and their instruments, Jin plays with the orchestra, impressing them with his powerful sound and ability to lead.\n\nAya, feeling the pressure of performing after Jin's impressive performance, reflects on her journey with music and the importance of expressing human emotions through it.

Mieko believes that knowing this is enough and that the true meaning of the Maestro's intentions may not matter in the end.\n\nAs the story concludes, Jin stands at the ocean's edge, contemplating the music that fills the world. He feels a connection to the music of the world and the friends he has made. He finds a perfectly shaped conch shell and marvels at the Fibonacci sequence present in its design.

His new home sparks curiosity among the neighbors, eliciting various opinions and speculations about his sanity. Meanwhile, Miguel, a curious young boy, becomes determined to visit Ramón's billboard house. He eventually convinces his aunt Paulina, who lived with Ramón for ten years, to take him there.\n\nRamón's past, his love for silence, his relationship with alcohol, and his belief in delicate threads connecting events above and below are revealed. His preference for silence and distance is attributed to a traumatic incident at his previous job, where a pipe cutter severed a coworker's arm. Miguel cherishes the time they spend together in that unusual space, though he knows Ramón won't stay there forever.\n\nPaulina, who works at a supermarket and has a talent for focusing on the present, reflects on her relationship with Ramón and the distance that has grown between them. She recalls a time when they were close, but now they live separate lives. Ramón's former coworkers also visit, trying to understand his new life.\n\nAs Ramón's life in the billboard becomes well-known, Miguel's life starts to change. His silence at school is seen as a form of rebellion, attracting the attention of his classmates.

Despite the uncertainty of their future and the looming threat of the neighborhood council's demands, Miguel and Ramón's friendship grows.\n\nMiguel encounters a young girl from the shanties near the housing complex, who bears a striking resemblance to a younger Paulina in an old photograph. This encounter leads Miguel to consider the cycles of life and the connections between people, places, and time. As Children's Day approaches, Miguel helps his mother with preparations for the celebration, while Ramón's future in the billboard house remains uncertain.\n\nDuring a Children's Day celebration, a girl from the shanties and her brothers are rejected from participating, causing tensions between the housing complex residents and the homeless population.

Ramón appears content in the company of his friends, even though he still prefers his life in the billboard house. As they enjoy their time together, a group of boys from Miguel's school, led by Donoso, decide to climb the billboard to see what it's like for themselves.

The residents of the complex are divided between those who live in proper buildings and those who live in makeshift shanties. Miguel befriends Ramón, a man who lives in a billboard house, and Paulina, a girl from the shanties. Ramón used to be romantically involved with Miguel's mother, and Miguel often refers to him as his father. The neighbors in the housing complex have mixed opinions about Ramón's new living situation, with some finding it amusing, others questioning his sanity, and a few remaining indifferent.\n\nMiguel is curious about Ramón's new home and convinces Paulina to take him up to the billboard. Ramón's dwelling is described as a ramshackle nest, with gaps between the planks that let in light, creating a cozy atmosphere. Ramón greets Miguel as if it's normal for him to visit, and they enjoy instant soup together while discussing their respective days. Throughout the story, Ramón's past is revealed, including his struggles with alcoholism and his search for silence and connection with the world around him. He believes there are delicate threads connecting what happens above and what happens below, and he has finally found the observatory he needs to explore these connections.\n\nAs the days go by, Miguel visits Ramón's billboard home several times, sometimes with Paulina, other times alone. They have conversations about life, connections between the earth and sky, and the importance of finding one's place in the world. Ramón's unique perspective on life and his search for silence and meaning resonate with Miguel, who begins to see the world differently through their interactions.\n\nMeanwhile, Miguel's mother is an active member of the neighborhood council and attends their meetings regularly. During one such meeting, the agenda includes discussing the billboard house and the homeless people living nearby. The council members express their desire for more public lighting to improve safety and for the homeless to be relocated. They also plan for the upcoming Children's Day celebration. Miguel attends the meeting with his mother but is more interested in the sandwiches and cookies served at the end.\n\nPaulina works at a supermarket called Superior, where her coworkers often mistake Miguel for her son. They play along with the misconception, calling each other \"mother\" and \"son.\" One day, Paulina shares a story about the Thai disinfectant used at the supermarket, which is rumored to cause death from overwork in its factory workers. The aisle manager uses this story to motivate the employees and discourage complaints.\n\nAfter the neighborhood council meeting, Miguel's mother confronts Paulina about Ramón's living situation, calling it an eyesore and demanding that he dismantle it. Paulina defends Ramón, stating that he is not bothering anyone and has the right to live as he wants. The argument escalates, and Paulina leaves angrily.\n\nMiguel starts to gain attention from his classmates, who have noticed him visiting the billboard house. They ask if he is the boy they have seen climbing up there, but Miguel neither confirms nor denies it. He decides to visit Ramón alone, without Paulina, to prove his courage and independence. Ramón welcomes him and allows him to do his homework at the billboard house.\n\nThe story takes a darker turn when a young boy from the housing complex named Jaimito goes missing, causing panic and suspicion among the residents. As the search for Jaimito continues, the residents start to blame Ramón and the homeless people for the boy's disappearance. They interrogate Miguel and his friends, demanding answers about their involvement with Ramón and their knowledge of Jaimito's whereabouts. Despite their innocence, the neighbors use this opportunity to try and get rid of Ramón and the homeless, whom they see as the root of their problems. Eventually, Jaimito's body is found in a canal, and the wake is held in the housing complex, where the residents come together in a temporary truce to mourn the boy's death.\n\nIn the end, Paulina decides that she and Miguel must leave the housing complex for good. They pack their belongings and set off on a journey to the city center, leaving behind the violence and intolerance of their community. As they walk along the highway, Miguel reflects on the events that led to their departure and the lessons he has learned about the cruelty of human nature. In the city, Miguel and Paulina try to build a new life for themselves, finding solace in each other's company and the freedom they now have.\n\nThe story of \"How to Turn Into a Bird\" is a poignant exploration of the effects of intolerance and fear on a community, as well as the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity. Through the experiences of Miguel and Paulina, the story highlights the importance of empathy and understanding in overcoming prejudice and division."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:49:07.902450Z","updated_at":"2023-09-21T11:59:12.636463Z","inner_id":10,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":58,"updated_by":7,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6642,"annotations":[{"id":2314,"completed_by":7,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"I403T5X4Ym","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"Z0kiyXzDkX","from_name":"structure","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 2 starts by providing more details.

She returns to Granby to teach a two-week course on podcasting, where she is flooded with memories and feelings of nervousness. While at Granby, she reunites with her best friend, Fran, who is now married to Anne. They reminisce about their time at Granby, discussing classmates who have died, including Thalia Keith, Bodie's former roommate whose murder still haunts her. As she explores the school grounds and interacts with current students, Bodie grapples with her feelings about Granby and the impact it had on her life. She acknowledges the school's flaws and the difficulties she faced there, but also recognizes the positive aspects and the ways it helped shape her into the person she is today.\n\nOne of Bodie's students, Britt, decides to create a podcast about Thalia's mysterious death and the subsequent conviction of Omar Evans, a Black athletic trainer at Granby who was accused of her murder. Britt believes that Omar is innocent and that the case against him was weak and racially motivated. Bodie is skeptical of Britt's claims, pointing out that the evidence against Omar was substantial, including his DNA on Thalia's swimsuit, a hair found in her mouth, and a noose drawn around her picture in a school directory. However, she encourages Britt to explore the case further, hoping that she will uncover the truth about what happened to Thalia.\n\nAs Bodie investigates Thalia's murder, she recalls her past relationships and friendships at Granby. She remembers rumors surrounding Thalia, including one that she had been engaged to a boy back home and her parents sent her to Granby to separate them, and another that she had left her previous school after being caught sleeping with her math teacher. Bodie also reflects on her relationship with her former teacher, Mr. Bloch, who never made any inappropriate advances towards her but was rumored to be involved with students, including Thalia. Bodie struggles with the idea of revisiting her past and the impact it has on her present life, as she is forced to confront the darker aspects of her high school experience and the changing social climate around issues of sexual harassment and assault.\n\nThroughout her time at Granby, Bodie continually questions the validity of the case against Omar and the true story behind Thalia's death. She wonders if Thalia and Omar were fighting at the pool edge, or if they were wrestling in the water and things got out of hand. However, none of these theories seem to match the evidence or the story Omar told and later recanted. Bodie is determined to find the truth and believes that the real story is hidden beneath layers of misinformation and bias.\n\nBodie, Britt, and Alder work together on the podcast, which gains traction and draws attention to the case. They receive a Dropbox link from Thalia's sister, Vanessa, containing over four hundred pages of documents related to the case, including interview transcripts, medical and legal records. As they uncover new information and discuss different perspectives, they are forced to confront their own biases and uncertainties.\n\nBodie and her friends, including Alder and Geoff, delve deeper into the case, focusing on the inconsistencies surrounding Thalia's death and the possibility that someone else, such as Robbie Serenho, Thalia's ex-boyfriend, may have been responsible. They speak with key witnesses, such as Beth Docherty and Mike Stiles, who provide new insights into Robbie's behavior and involvement with Thalia. Despite the growing suspicion that Robbie is the real murderer, they still lack concrete evidence to prove their theory.\n\nAs the story progresses, Bodie and her friends continue to seek evidence and support for Omar's innocence. They find more people who have been affected by the actions of those involved in the case, such as Paula Gutierrez and Allison Mayfield, former students who are ready to go public with their stories. Bodie wonders what she has to lose by confronting those who have remained silent about the truth, including Mike Stiles and Dennis Bloch, a music teacher who may be connected to the case.\n\nIn the end, the protagonist returns to Granby to sprinkle her friend Carlotta's ashes into the Tigerwhip, as per Carlotta's wishes. She reminisces about the past, thinking about her friends, including Omar, Thalia, and Fran. Bodie feels a sense of lightness despite the sadness of losing Carlotta and acknowledges the support she has received from various people throughout her life.\n\nThe story explores themes of nostalgia, identity, adolescence, friendship, and the lasting impact of high school experiences on one's psyche. It also delves into the complexities of human nature and the power of storytelling in shaping our lives and identities. Despite the setbacks in the case and the uncertainty of Omar's fate, Bodie remains determined to fight for justice and uncover the truth about Thalia's murder.","summary_2":"Elizabeth, a podcast host, returns to her alma mater Granby to teach a podcasting class and reminisce about her past, including the murders of her former classmate Thalia and a teacher in the '70s.

Throughout the book, she explores her life situations, searching for the fundamental causes of her feelings to help her move in a healthier direction. Baek Sehee has always been introverted and sensitive, and her depression worsened in high school, affecting her studies and future. Despite changing various aspects of her life, her depression persisted. She became increasingly paranoid and anxious around others but expertly acted like everything was fine. Eventually, she decided to seek help from a psychiatrist.\n\nDuring her sessions, Baek Sehee discusses her low self-esteem, which she attributes to her upbringing. Her family lived in a small apartment, and her mother often lamented their poverty. Additionally, her father was physically abusive towards her mother and sisters, creating a sense of shame and secrecy. Her relationship with her older sister was also problematic, as her sister's love was conditional and manipulative. Baek Sehee's romantic relationships were passive, with her partners usually approaching her first. She became heavily dependent on them but also resented this dependence and wanted to be self-sufficient. Her friendships were affected by her experiences with bullying in school, leading her to develop a fear of straying from the herd and being nervous about friendships in general.\n\nHer work in marketing for a publisher was satisfying, but she felt pressure to constantly achieve better results. The psychiatrist suggests that Baek Sehee has a tendency to be co-dependent and needs to break out of the cycle of failure and depression. They recommend starting with small challenges to help her break this cycle. Baek Sehee also shares her obsession with not inconveniencing others and her struggle to tolerate people's complicated behaviors.

She talks about her time at a movie club and how she felt intimidated by the prestigious backgrounds of the other members. The psychiatrist encourages her to focus on what she truly wants in life, rather than worrying about societal expectations and comparisons. She reveals her history of eczema and an incident in middle school where she was targeted by anonymous online bullies who criticized her appearance. These experiences have led to her constant self-surveillance and a habit of recording her conversations to evaluate her own behavior.\n\nThe psychiatrist advises Baek Sehee to separate her work and personal life and to focus on personal desires and finding joy in her own life, rather than worrying about societal norms and external validation. She also discusses her new friend, who she feels a strong connection with despite their differences. She expresses her fear of losing this friend and being seen as a burden due to her anxiety.

Despite Nurse Ratched's warning, Victor decides to repair him. They manage to fix Hap's limbs but struggle with finding a suitable power source and repairing his synthetic skin. Upon reviving Hap, they learn his memories were wiped during decommissioning. Struggling to adapt to his new wooden limbs and mechanical heart, Hap questions his existence and lunges at Victor. Later, Hap saves a butterfly, causing Giovanni to question his motivations.\n\nAs they help Hap adjust to his new life, the group deals with his unpredictable behavior and encounters a massive flying machine, \"The Terrible Dogfish,\" which takes away three identical humanoid machines. This sparks questions about their purpose and implications for their own existence. In a hidden bunker, Giovanni reveals that he created Hap to annihilate humans. The machines, led by a leader with a fox and cat symbol, kidnap Giovanni, burn the treehouse complex, and trap the group in the bunker. They must now decide their next move given these shocking truths.\n\nVictor, Hap, Nurse Ratched, and Rambo set out to find Giovanni and the mysterious City of Electric Dreams. They come across a floating house with loud music owned by a mysterious android, the Coachman, who offers them a ride to the city. Suspicious, they refuse and continue on foot.

A robot identical to Hap, but named HARP, confronts the Coachman, demanding to inspect his house for humans. The Coachman deceives HARP, but the group is left wondering about Hap's connection to HARP.\n\nApproaching the City of Electric Dreams, they learn of the Benevolent Tower, where Giovanni is supposedly held.

As they prepare to give him the heart, Victor warns him of the potential pain and burden it may bring. Despite this, Dad trusts Victor and allows him to proceed.\n\nAs they settle into their new home, the group continues to work on restoring Dad's memories and helping Hap adjust.

He befriends Rakeem, another teenager at the retreat who shares his skepticism about Reconciliation. Rakeem reveals the ultimate goal of the program is to break down the participants' sense of self-worth and force them to accept Deacon's version of the world. The \"reconciliation\" ceremony is a traumatizing experience designed to make participants feel as if they have been healed by giving themselves over to Christ's Dominion.\n\nManny is eventually cast out by the Sullivans and ends up hitchhiking and taking odd jobs to survive. He encounters various people along the way, including the Varela family, who take him in temporarily. The Varelas, consisting of Ricardo, Monica, and their son Carlos, have a history of helping children who have been ejected from their previous homes. They offer to help Manny find Elena, and together they embark on a journey to uncover the truth about Christ's Dominion and Reconciliation.\n\nAs Manny travels with the Varela family, he becomes increasingly anxious about the possibility that a body found in Idyllwild, near a property owned by Christ's Dominion, might be Elena. He also struggles with his feelings for Carlos, who he learns is also adopted and has a history of being rejected by his birth family due to allegations against a church leader, Lester. Manny's relationship with the Varela family is strained, as they see him as secretive and impenetrable.\n\nManny and the Varelas eventually arrive at the Department of Public Social Services, hoping to find more information about Elena's whereabouts. They speak to a supervisor, Rachel Danforth, and Manny's social worker, Diana Rogers. However, they are met with resistance and dismissal, leaving them frustrated and without any leads. Continuing their journey, Manny and the Varelas return to the neighborhood where Manny used to live before being taken to Reconciliation. They pass by the house of Nestor, a boy Manny once had a secret relationship with. The sight of his old neighborhood and the Sullivans' house fills Manny with a mix of terror, anticipation, and uncertainty.\n\nThroughout the story, Manny reflects on his experiences in foster care, his time at Reconciliation, and his relationships with the various people he encounters. He grapples with questions about trust, healing, and the power of choice in one's life. As the story progresses, Manny and the Varelas remain determined to uncover the truth about Christ's Dominion, Reconciliation, and Elena's whereabouts, despite the challenges and uncertainties they face.\n\nIn a dramatic confrontation with Deacon and the Sullivans, Manny offers Elena a chance to leave with him, but she refuses, believing the outside world is poisoned. Manny leaves the community with Carlos and the Varelas, who have rescued several other children from Reconciliation. As they drive away, they see the forest behind them ablaze, with Elena walking towards them, having made her own choice to leave the community. Manny feels a sense of righteousness and believes this is what God must feel like.\n\nThe story ends with Manny vowing to continue uncovering the truth about Reconciliation and helping others who have suffered at the hands of the Sullivans and Christ's Dominion. Through his journey and experiences, Manny learns the importance of trust, healing, and the power of choice, as he and the Varelas work together to expose the dark secrets of the religious organization and rescue those who have been manipulated and deceived by its leaders."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:49:07.902823Z","updated_at":"2023-09-22T18:18:27.589490Z","inner_id":14,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":58,"updated_by":7,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6646,"annotations":[{"id":2338,"completed_by":7,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"YBJlUJ5hx8","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["Summary 2 has important details missing in 1, such as telling us that thirst-trap and Tarik are the same person.

Her passion for training rocs began in childhood after encountering a young ruhker and his roc. She bonds with Zahra through the \"five days of darkness\" ritual, where the duo is enclosed in darkness to acclimate themselves. Ester gains Zahra's trust by feeding and speaking soothingly to her, sharing personal stories and secrets.\n\nUpon emerging from the darkness, fellow apprentice Darius praises Zahra's strength and potential. With mentor Nasmin away, Ester's apprenticeship continues under Darius's guidance. They work together to train their rocs, introducing the hood, lure, and methods for jumping from perch to chariot. Initially cold and distant, Darius becomes more supportive and helpful, and their bond strengthens as they embark on a hunt together.\n\nDuring a hunt, Ester and Darius encounter signs of a dangerous manticore that killed a farmer. They follow the trail but decide not to risk their rocs, returning to warn others instead. The manticore is eventually killed, and Ester feels relieved about their decision. Working together, Ester and Darius develop a deep friendship, with Ester eager to hunt manticores with Zahra someday.\n\nUnexpectedly, Prince Khovash visits Ester while training Zahra. Struck by his demeanor and fascination with rocs, Ester shares her goal of hunting manticores with Zahra. Impressed, the prince admires her determination and belief in her purpose. Following the visit, Ester and Zahra continue diligent training and are soon assigned to a team hunting two manticores that attacked a trade caravan. Ester and Darius, now a formidable team, set out with their rocs to fulfill their ruhkers' mission.\n\nThey track down the manticores, taking different paths but only finding one, injured by Darius's roc, Minu, before Zahra delivers the finishing blow. While field dressing the manticore, Prince Khovash appears, congratulating them on their successful hunt. His admiration fortifies Ester's sense of purpose as a ruhker, and she looks forward to more hunts with Zahra and Darius.\n\nEster and Nasmin are invited to a royal feast, where Nasmin catches Prince Khovash's attention. It's revealed that the prince plans to embark on a royal tour promoting ruhking, with Nasmin and her roc Azar accompanying him as ambassadors. Ester feels proud yet somewhat resentful due to the shifting nature of their friendship. Nevertheless, her bond with Darius remains strong as they continue their shared passion for ruhking.\n\nEster and Darius participate in the Great Hunt, a joint campaign between the Royal Mews and General Zubin's Third Division to eradicate manticores in the eastern satrapies. Despite concerns about rocs being too close together and the distraction of an army, the ruhkers are excited for the chance to make an impact on the manticore population. Ester and Darius work with Yellow Company, led by Captain Omid, but struggle to find manticores. Tragedy strikes when two men from their company are killed by a manticore. The hunt intensifies, with Ester and Darius more determined than ever to protect their fellow soldiers and fulfill their roles as ruhkers.\n\nDuring the hunt, a manticore evades Zahra, and Darius sends Minu into the sky to continue the pursuit. They corner the manticore in some oak trees, but another roc, Azar, attacks Minu in a territorial rage. Darius rushes to save Minu, getting injured in the process. The manticore escapes, and Minu is fatally injured. Darius is left broken, both physically and emotionally. Ester and Darius part ways, with Ester returning to the mews and Darius remaining to recover. Ester continues training with Zahra but misses Darius and their partnership.\n\nNasmin, who lost control of Azar during the incident, sees her reputation among ruhkers tarnished. She eventually retires the Red Angel, releases Azar, and settles down with a wealthy spice merchant. Ester reflects on the sacrifices made by herself and her friends in pursuit of ruhking, and the impact of their choices on them and those around them. Despite the challenges and losses, Ester and Darius remain bound by their shared passion for training rocs and hunting manticores, with the hope that they may reunite and continue their journey together.\n\nEster finds herself in a village where a manticore has been sighted. She sets out to track and kill the beast, eventually confronting it in a field. During the battle, her chariot is overturned, leaving her injured and trapped beneath it. Zahra kills the manticore, but then a wild male roc appears, capturing her attention. Ester desperately tries to call her back, but Zahra ultimately flies away with the male, leaving Ester alone and helpless.\n\nAs Ester resigns herself to her fate, Darius arrives to rescue her. He has changed since they last saw each other, with a newfound sense of purpose and determination. He helps Ester by providing food, water, and a splint for her leg before lifting her onto his horse. Together, they face the challenges and losses that have come their way, their bond stronger than ever as they continue their shared passion for training rocs and hunting manticores. They ride back toward the mews where, come spring, there would be new monsters to tame.","summary_2":"In \"Untethered Sky,\" Ester, an eighteen-year-old woman, becomes a ruhker apprentice, training a year-old fledgling roc named Zahra in the Royal Mews under the watchful eye of Babak. Ruhkers are individuals who train and care for rocs, massive birds of prey used for hunting dangerous creatures like manticores. Ester's background includes a fascination with falconry, sparked when she encountered a ruhker on an outing with her falcon, Cas. Her family includes her late brother Arnan and her parents, who tried desperately to have more children after her birth.\n\nDuring her apprenticeship, Ester forms friendships with fellow ruhkers Nasmin and Darius. She spends six days in complete darkness with Zahra, bonding with the bird and sharing her life story, including the traumatic memory of her family being attacked by a manticore that killed her mother and brother. Ester is haunted by the question of why she survived the attack and becomes determined to hunt manticores.\n\nEster and Darius train their rocs to hunt predators, eventually discovering a manticore attack on a trade caravan. They are assigned by Babak to one of three teams sent to hunt down the manticores. Ester is nervous about the upcoming hunt but takes it as a good sign when Zahra tears apart a manticore pelt before they set out. The two ruhkers travel to the site of the attack and prepare to begin their hunt.\n\nEster and Darius, along with other ruhkers and soldiers, participate in the Great Hunt, aiming to make the eastern satrapies safe from manticores. They are attached to Yellow Company, commanded by Captain Omid, and spend days searching for manticores without success. Their luck changes when two men from Yellow Company are found dead, killed by a manticore during the night. Ester and Darius realize they must continue their hunt for the dangerous beast.\n\nDuring the hunt, Ester and Darius corner the manticore, but it escapes after a fierce battle with Minu, Darius's roc. Ester releases Zahra, who swiftly kills the manticore with a powerful strike to its head. Ester feels a sense of purpose and accomplishment, having achieved her goal of becoming a manticore killer.\n\nFollowing the successful hunt, Ester and her fellow ruhker Nasmin travel to Antopolis for a ceremony where Ester will receive holy ashes as a symbol of her new status as a fully-fledged ruhker. During their visit, Ester discovers that Prince Khovash, who has shown interest in her, is more interested in Nasmin. Ester feels hurt and betrayed but remains focused on her duty as a ruhker and her bond with Zahra.\n\nEster continues her journey as a ruhker, training Zahra to hunt and kill prey. She struggles with Zahra's moody behavior but eventually makes progress in her training. Ester's relationship with Darius grows closer, and they become more reliant on each other, sharing the joys and challenges of their profession.\n\nThe protagonist finds herself in a village that has been terrorized by a manticore. She sets out with Zahra to track and kill the manticore, but her chariot crashes during the hunt, trapping her leg beneath it. As she awaits death, the protagonist sees Darius approaching on horseback. He has come to rescue her, and his eyes hold a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nDarius helps the protagonist by splinting her swollen leg and providing food and water. He explains that he had left the inn a day after her departure, regretting not going with her initially. In a village by the river, he learned that she had set off alone but never returned, prompting him to track her down. The protagonist and Darius don't discuss the dead manticore or the overturned chariot, instead focusing on their journey back to the mews where they will tame new monsters in the spring.\n\n\"Untethered Sky\" is a story of friendship, duty, and the challenges faced by those who dedicate their lives to protecting others from dangerous creatures. Ester, Darius, and their fellow ruhkers navigate the complexities of their profession, forging bonds with their rocs and each other as they hunt the deadly manticores that threaten their kingdom."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-18T19:49:07.903097Z","updated_at":"2023-09-21T10:34:40.501609Z","inner_id":17,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":58,"updated_by":7,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6649,"annotations":[{"id":2336,"completed_by":7,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"5JmzO8pao1","from_name":"detail","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Yes"]},"id":"tFqOiF1Hfq","from_name":"contradiction","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["In summary 1, we learn more about Julia and Marshall's relationship with, \"Julia Chen adjusts to life without her husband, Marshall, who left her.\" Details like this, \" At Julia's house, Vera wins over Emma by introducing herself as Grandma Vera,\" that help describe Vera's relationship with Emma are not in summary 2.

The only remaining regular customer is Alex, an elderly man whose wife, Lily, suffers from Alzheimer's. Vera is a diligent and compassionate person, always giving advice to her son, Tilbert (Tilly), even though he rarely asks for it. The story follows the lives of two women, Vera and Julia, as they face their own personal struggles.\n\nJulia is a single mother struggling to cope with her husband Marshall's sudden departure. When two police officers, Officer Ha and Officer Gray, arrive at Julia's door with news of Marshall's death, Julia's life is turned upside down. Marshall was found dead at Vera Wang's World-Famous Teahouse, and the circumstances surrounding his death are unclear. As the story unfolds, Vera becomes determined to solve the mystery of Marshall's death and forms an unlikely alliance with Riki Herwanto, a young man who knew the deceased. Riki pretends to be a reporter for an online news outlet called The Bay Buzz, and together they investigate the case. They come across several suspects, including Sana, a young woman with a true crime podcast, and Oliver, Marshall's twin brother.\n\nVera discovers a hidden laptop in Julia's garage that contains a folder with Sana's name on it, revealing that Marshall had stolen her artwork and sold it as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) online. Sana, who had been swindled by Marshall, shares her story with Julia and Vera, and they agree to help her regain ownership of her art. Meanwhile, Riki confesses to Vera that he had created a scalping bot for Marshall to scam people into overpaying for stolen art, but he regrets his actions and wants to make amends.\n\nAs the investigation continues, Oliver struggles with his feelings for Julia, his dead brother's wife, and his guilt over not being a better son to his dad. Julia discovers a manuscript written by Oliver that reveals his feelings for her, leaving her feeling shocked and betrayed. The tension builds as Julia faces questioning from Officer Gray, who suspects Oliver's involvement in Marshall's death.\n\nVera decides to host a dinner party to gather all the suspects and figure out who the real killer is. The dinner takes a dramatic turn when Officer Gray arrives with a warrant to search Oliver's premises and takes him to the police station for questioning. Oliver becomes increasingly anxious and unsure of what to say as Officer Gray presses him about his feelings for Julia and his relationship with Marshall. At the dinner party, Oliver admits that he planted drugs in Marshall's bag as an attempt to get him in trouble, but ultimately chickened out on calling the police. He explains that he had always been overshadowed by Marshall and wanted to see him face consequences for his actions. The group is left stunned and confused, still unsure of who actually killed Marshall.\n\nVera admits to her friends that she broke into her own shop and smashed it up to make it look like someone had broken in. She did this to make it more obvious that someone was involved in Marshall's murder and to keep everyone focused on solving it. Vera also reveals that she found a flash drive in Marshall's hand when she discovered his body, which she took and later found out that it was a key to unlock his computer. On the computer, she discovered the NFTs and a scalping bot that Riki had built for Marshall. This revelation causes a rift between Riki and Sana, as Sana is furious that Riki was involved in Marshall's scam without questioning it.\n\nVera is asked to leave Julia's house and returns to her empty teahouse, feeling defeated and purposeless. Riki finds Vera in her bedroom, frail and unresponsive. He calls 911, and Vera is taken to the hospital. Sana, despite her anger at Riki, goes to visit Vera in the hospital. During her recovery, Vera's teahouse undergoes a transformation, with Sana creating a beautiful mural on the walls, Riki refurbishing the furniture, and Oliver fixing the lighting.\n\nVera is determined to solve the mystery of Marshall's death, which is believed to be caused by an acute allergic reaction to bird dander. She realizes that her jar of bird's nest, a key ingredient in her special tea, is missing and suspects that it might be connected to Marshall's death. After questioning Oliver about his father, Alex, she becomes convinced that Alex is the culprit. Vera and her friends confront Alex at his apartment, where he confesses to killing his son, Marshall. Alex explains that he was appalled by Marshall's behavior and treatment of his wife, Julia, and daughter, Emma. He also reveals that he was the one who had been secretly watching Julia and Vera to ensure their safety.\n\nThe story concludes with the characters enjoying their time together at Vera's teahouse, which has gained newfound popularity thanks to Julia's photography, Sana's artwork, and word of mouth. They discuss various aspects of their lives, such as Riki's brother Adi joining them in the Bay Area, and the fact that Riki and Sana are working on returning stolen art to its rightful owners.

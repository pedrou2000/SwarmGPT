The first paragraph of Summary 1 introduces the main characters by explaining who they are. For example: \"The story follows the intertwined lives of several characters, including Unora, daughter of the banished Governor of Afa; Sabran, the Queen of Inys; Esbar, a girl from the Lasian Basin; Dumai, a princess and daughter of Emperor Jorodu and Unora; Tunuva and Esbar, two mages from the Ersyr; and Wulf, a warrior from the North.\" This provides a better understanding of who is who, when each of them is later mentioned in the summary. However, Summar 2 does not provide such explanation. For example: \"Political tensions rise as Sabran allies with King Bardholt, Tunuva and Esbar face a crisis with Siyu's pregnancy, sending them eastward.\" This leads to confusion - who is Sabran? Who are Tunuva and Esbar? Who is Siyu? This problem is also present later in Summary 2 (e.g. Glorian).\n2. In terms of overall structure and pace, Summary 2 is by far better structured. Each paragraph talks about a specific event or several events that seem to be taking place at the same time, which makes the summary more comprehensible. Some paragraphs in Summary 1 (e.g. 2nd and 4th) are too long and could be easily split in half to improve readability.\n3. Summary 2 provides a more logical sequence of the events than Summary 1, stating exactly what is happening. Summary 1 is filled with general statements that could easily be said about any story or book. For example, \"The story also touches on the importance of loyalty, courage, and the bonds between friends and family members, as well as the challenges that come with navigating complex relationships and societal expectations.\" There are a lot of these statements throughout the summary, making it more like an analytical essay than an actual summary. In addition, there are statements in Summary 1 that seem redundant, such as this: \"Throughout the story, characters such as Tunuva Melim, Unora of Afa, and Glorian Hraustr Berethnet are born and face various challenges and adventures.\" This is mentioned near the end of the summary, but why talk about the birth of Tunuva, Unora and Glorian at the end, when these characters were already extensively described in the previous paragraphs?\n4. Summary 1 talks a lot about Esbar (not always clear though, if it's about Esbar, a girl from the Lasian Basin or Esbar, a mage from the Ersyr), making her seem to be an important character. Meanwhile, Esbar is just once mentioned in Summary 2. In addition, Summary 2 makes it seem like Dumai is the main character of the story, while Nikeya is a pretty important character too. However, while Dumai is mentioned here and there in Summary 1, there is absolutely no mention of Nikey in Summary 1. From the events in Summary 2, it is clear that she is an important character and should definitely be mentioned."]},"id":"SyGB6OpZ0h","from_name":"thoughts","to_name":"summary_1","type":"textarea","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-09-17T11:08:00.153022Z","updated_at":"2023-09-17T11:08:00.153064Z","lead_time":3879.136,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"12f6389a-ea1e-4f35-84f0-4b8382bcf847","last_action":null,"task":6582,"project":52,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f8c09fe1-data_ilze.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"book":"a-day-of-fallen-night.epub","summary_1":"A Day of Fallen Night is set in a world divided into different kingdoms, where dragons and magic play a significant role.

She becomes involved with Emperor Jorodu, eventually becoming pregnant with Dumai. Meanwhile, Sabran marries a noble of Yscalin, but he dies shortly after their wedding. She then seeks to unite her kingdom with Hróth, ruled by King Bardholt, to prevent further wars. In the South, Esbar is born and welcomed into the Priory, while Dumai discovers her true heritage and heads to Antuma Palace to prove herself worthy of the throne. Tunuva and Esbar, the mages from the Ersyr, set out to find their sisters Siyu and Yeleni, who have run away. They eventually find Yeleni, who regrets her decision and wants to return home. However, they must flee the area when the Dreadmount, a volcano that birthed the evil Nameless One, erupts.\n\nIn the North, Wulf is part of a group called the lith, led by Regny of Askrdal. They are tasked by King Bardholt to investigate a reported sickness in the village of Ófandauth. The village is deserted, and Wulf discovers strange rocks that emit a sense of revulsion and wrongness. As the story progresses, the characters face challenges and difficult decisions, including Glorian's marriage to Magnaust Vatten, Dumai's struggle to reconcile her past and newfound identity as a princess, and Tunuva and Esbar's mission to protect their world from the threat of the Dreadmount and the Nameless One.\n\nDumai travels to Sepul to warn Queen Arkoro about the dangerous rocks and seeks the help of an alchemist named Kiprun of Brakwa. Meanwhile, Glorian grapples with her parents' deaths and the responsibilities of her future as a queen. Tunuva and Esbar navigate complex relationships and power dynamics within the Priory, as they deal with the mysterious Canthe and the potential threat of the Nameless One. The characters' lives become increasingly intertwined as they face loss, grief, and the consequences of their actions. Wulf's immunity to the plague raises questions about his connection to the Saint, while Glorian's determination to fight and train demonstrates her desire to maintain control over her destiny. The relationships between the characters, particularly between Tunuva and Esbar, and Glorian and her parents, play a significant role in shaping their motivations and actions.\n\nThe story also touches on the importance of loyalty, courage, and the bonds between friends and family members, as well as the challenges that come with navigating complex relationships and societal expectations. As the characters confront their enemies and face the consequences of their decisions, they are ultimately united by a common goal: to stop the wyrms and save their world from destruction. In the end, the characters must rely on their strength, courage, and loyalty to each other to overcome the challenges and dangers that lie ahead, as they navigate the complexities of their world and forge new alliances in the face of adversity.\n\nThroughout the story, characters such as Tunuva Melim, Unora of Afa, and Glorian Hraustr Berethnet are born and face various challenges and adventures. The timeline of events reaches CE 509, when a Day of Fallen Night begins, marking a significant turning point in the story. The characters' objectives and motivations vary, but they are all connected through their shared history and the looming threat of the Nameless One.\n\nIn conclusion, A Day of Fallen Night is a complex tale of intertwined lives, set in a world filled with magic, dragons, and political intrigue. The story follows the struggles and triumphs of Unora, Sabran, Esbar, Dumai, Tunuva, and Wulf, as they navigate their destinies and face the consequences of their actions. The characters' lives are shaped by their relationships, loyalties, and the challenges they face in a world on the brink of destruction. As the Day of Fallen Night approaches, they must unite their strengths and overcome their fears to save their world and forge a new future.","summary_2":"Unora encounters the dragon Pajati and Emperor Jorodu, leading to a secret relationship and the birth of their daughter, Dumai.

In general, it is easy to read both summaries. In both summaries, the paragraphs are well-structured, with each paragraph talking about a specific event.

The story is set in London, where Rob and his wife, Leah, moved from Los Angeles. When Henry was around 11 months old, he started vomiting frequently, which led to weight loss and concern from his parents. They took him to various doctors and hospitals, trying to find the cause of his vomiting. After seeing multiple doctors, they were finally referred to Dr. Anson, who suggested an MRI of Henry's head to check for a tumor. The family was terrified at the possibility of a tumor, and they anxiously awaited the results of the MRI.\n\nLeah and the narrator discover that their one-year-old son, Henry, has a large brain tumor near his brain stem. Dr. Anson breaks the news to them, and they are devastated. The couple is introduced to Mr. Elsawi, a brain surgeon who will attempt to remove the tumor. After a thirteen-hour surgery, Mr. Elsawi informs them that he has removed all the tumor he could find. However, the surgery has left Henry with burns on his torso, numerous tubes and wires attached to him, and the inability to swallow.\n\nThe family navigates life in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and oncology ward at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Despite the challenges, Henry and his family find solace in the compassionate care provided by the hospital staff, particularly healthcare assistant Katie, who forms a deep bond with the young boy. As Henry undergoes chemotherapy, his parents decide to begin sleeping at their nearby home, allowing them to process their emotions and bond with each other during this difficult time.\n\nThe narrator discusses the challenges of balancing family life and work, particularly during the production of the TV show \"Catastrophe.\" The narrator admits to being a workaholic during the first two seasons, neglecting his wife Leah and their children. However, after Leah threatens to leave him, he learns to work more efficiently and focus on his family. Unfortunately, tragedy strikes again when the narrator learns that his brother-in-law Tobias has committed suicide. The narrator is devastated by the news and reflects on how he and Leah loved Tobias.\n\nDespite the challenges and heartbreak, the family manages to find moments of joy and togetherness, celebrating holidays in Henry's hospital room and supporting one another through their struggles. As Henry's condition worsens, the family is faced with the reality that he now has a tracheostomy, a breathing tube inserted in the base of his neck, which they must learn to care for. Throughout all the painful procedures, Henry does not cry.\n\nWhen Henry's cancer returns, the family is devastated. They decide not to pursue further treatment, as it would only prolong his suffering. The narrator talks about the varied responses they receive from people upon hearing the news, including a particularly comforting response from one of Henry's night carers, Rachel. However, not everyone is supportive, and one of Henry's carers, Mira, disagrees with their decision and eventually cuts ties with the family.\n\nDuring this time, Leah becomes pregnant with their fourth child, Teddy. The narrator wonders what it must have been like for her to be pregnant while knowing she would soon lose one of her other children. After Teddy is born, the family finds joy in his laughter and happiness.\n\nThe narrator reflects on the emotional journey his family has gone through since their son Henry's cancer diagnosis. At age eleven, Eugene expresses anger and guilt for having gone to school a few hours after Henry's death. The narrator reassures him that he and his younger brother Oscar were just doing what they felt they were supposed to do at that time.\n\nAs Henry's condition worsens, his blood oxygen levels drop dangerously low, and the palliative care team confirms that he will soon die.

Dr. Anson diagnoses Henry with a large brain tumor near his brain stem, and pediatric brain surgeon Mr. Elsawi is brought in to help. Throughout their ordeal, Rob and Leah find comfort in each other and their friends for support.\n\nDespite multiple surgeries and extensive care, Henry's condition worsens, and the family is forced to face the reality of losing their beloved child as he loses the ability to swallow and requires a tracheostomy. They spend time in hospital-provided housing called the Italian House, processing their emotions and bonding in the difficult circumstances. They involve Henry's brothers, Eugene and Oscar, in their time at the hospital, celebrating holidays and spending time together as a family. Rob reflects on his growth as a husband and father, admitting that he was initially a workaholic and neglectful during the early seasons of his TV show, Catastrophe. He credits his wife and son's illness for teaching him the importance of prioritizing his family relationships.\n\nRob and Leah protect their marriage throughout Henry's illness, going on weekly dates and maintaining daily communication. They also involve Eugene and Oscar in their time at the hospital. Sadly, during Henry's treatment, Rob receives news that his brother-in-law, Tobias, has taken his own life. The family grieves this additional loss while still supporting Henry through his final days. Rob recounts his conversations with Tobias about depression and reflects on the importance of seeking help and support.

Amidst the immense pain and suffering, they find solace in each other, their friends, and their family members who fly in to help. Their strength and determination to maintain their relationships serve as a testament to the power of love and family in the face of unimaginable grief.\n\nRob finds comfort in the music of Elliott Smith and emotionally connects with Asgeir's music, an Icelandic artist whose father, a poet, wrote all of his lyrics. Due to Henry's tracheostomy, he loses his ability to speak but learns to communicate through Makaton, a language program using symbols, signs, and speech. Rob encounters Singing Hands, a duo that performs songs using Makaton, and they become an essential part of Henry's life. After Henry's death, Rob reads a CBeebies Bedtime Story using Makaton, honoring his son's memory. The couple fights to get Henry home from the hospital, but the government's underfunding of social care makes it difficult. Despite the challenges, Rob and Leah's love for Henry endures.\n\nDuring Henry's time at home, the family benefits from two charities, Rainbow Trust and Noah's Ark, which provide support and care. Rob's father helps care for Henry, becoming one of the few non-healthcare professionals allowed to be alone with him. Rob focuses on fundraising for these charities. Meanwhile, Rob's father faces health challenges of his own, being diagnosed with blood cancer due to exposure to Agent Orange during his service in Vietnam. Rob's mother, despite being divorced from his father for over 30 years, steps up to support him, showcasing an incredible act of grace that restores Rob's faith in humanity.\n\nAs Henry's condition worsens, he becomes more sluggish and shows signs of pain. The family calls in a palliative care team, who prescribe morphine and gabapentin to help with his pain. Rob and Leah take turns administering the medication and holding their son, who clings to a Lego Duplo ice cream cone for comfort.

The family welcomes a new addition, Teddy, born a few months after Henry's death.\n\nDespite the immense grief, Rob's family continues to support and love each other, finding joy and laughter in daily life. They honor Henry's memory through their love for one another and their determination to face the challenges that life brings. Rob shares his gratitude for the many friends and family members who provided love and kindness throughout Henry's life and after his death, acknowledging the vast network of support that helped them through the difficult times.\n\nIn the end, Rob terms his belief that when he dies, his essence will mingle with Henry's in a vast, metaphorical ocean, though he may not be able to recognize him, but the love and connection will still remain. The story of Rob and Leah's love, resilience, and strength in the face of unimaginable grief serves as a testament to the power of family and the enduring bonds that connect us, even beyond death."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-12T21:31:12.083061Z","updated_at":"2023-09-17T12:48:51.910165Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":52,"updated_by":8,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6584,"annotations":[{"id":2289,"completed_by":8,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"ICj3SgoDjl","from_name":"preference","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["1.

She is concerned about her mother Edith's appearance, as she has lost a significant amount of weight since they last saw each other. Samantha also notices several changes in the house, such as the new ecru paint and the reappearance of an old, tacky painting of a Confederate wedding that her mother had previously taken down. Throughout the story, Samantha reflects on her childhood memories and her relationship with her late grandmother, Gran Mae, who had strong opinions about class and race. Samantha's brother, Brad, had mentioned that something odd was going on with their mother, but he didn't seem to know the details.\n\nSamantha visits Gail, a neighbor and friend of her mother's, who tells her about the vultures staring at her mother's house. Gail believes that the vultures are sensitive to the dead and that they are drawn to the house because of Samantha's grandmother's spirit. Gail insists that her grandmother was a sorcerer and that she put her energy into the roses in her garden. Samantha is skeptical but agrees to keep an open mind. While searching for tampons in her mother's bathroom, Samantha discovers a series of notes written by her mother, revealing her mother's apparent paranoia and hallucinations, as well as her desperate attempts to reassure herself that everything is okay.\n\nSamantha continues researching her family's history and discovers that her great-grandfather, Elgar Mills, was a sorcerer and was associated with Jack Parsons, a rocket scientist and follower of the occultist Aleister Crowley. As she continues her research, the protagonist learns more about the strange world of occultism and its connections to famous figures like Robert Heinlein and L. Ron Hubbard.\n\nIn a surreal and tense confrontation, Samantha and her mother are attacked by underground children, monstrous creatures created by her great-grandfather Elgar. Sam's mother, Edie, and her friends, Phil and Gail, are trapped on the roof of the house, while Sam is in the yard. Samantha realizes that she has inherited some magical abilities and uses the power of the roses in her garden to push the creatures away. Despite the initial success, more creatures continue to emerge, and Samantha decides to try something more drastic. With the power of the roses and Gran Mae's spirit, Sam commands the roses to burn.\n\nSam wakes up with a throbbing headache and injured hands, covered in blisters and black ash. His mother, Gail, and Phil are there with him, and they are all in a dark, underground space. Sam remembers the underground children attacking them and how he had used the power of the roses to fight them off. The roses had erupted in a roselight, burning Sam's hands and causing the children to be wrapped in ashy stems. Hermes, Gail's vulture, helps them escape the underground space.\n\nDays later, Sam and his family are recovering from their ordeal. The official explanation for the destruction of their house is that it fell into a sinkhole, and no one questions their injuries. Sam and his mother stay with Gail, and they discuss what happened with the underground children. Gail reveals that they were hybrid creatures created by Elgar Mills, Sam's great-grandfather, who had dabbled in alchemy and ritual magic. The children had turned against Elgar and his daughter, Gran Mae, who had used the power of the roses to keep them at bay.\n\nSam wonders if Gran Mae had planned to teach him how to control the roses and keep the underground children away. Gail suggests that Sam might consider growing a garden of his own, but without the dangerous roses. She also warns Sam that, although most of the underground children are dead, it would be safer for him and his family to move away from their current location, as the creatures might still be attracted to their bloodline.\n\nSam's mother decides to move to Arizona, and Sam asks Gail to look out for Phil, who has become a friend during their ordeal.

She discovers a photo from her high school graduation with a child's hand visible in the background, and finds the same mysterious hand in another photo in the attic. Samantha delves into her great-grandfather's history, finding connections to Jack Parsons, an associate of Aleister Crowley and founder of the religion Thelema. Parsons had sought advice from her great-grandfather about creating a magical child but was warned against it. This revelation increases Samantha's determination to uncover the truth about her family's secrets.\n\nWhile setting up a pitfall trap in the garden, Samantha discovers a mysterious glass jar buried in the soil, filled with human teeth. She confronts her mother about the jar, and her mother admits she believes she is being haunted by her dead grandmother, who appears to have become a rose-petal apparition. Struggling to come to terms with the situation, Samantha tries to find some semblance of normalcy for herself and her mother, despite the chilling discoveries and the ever-present sense of unease.\n\nAs Samantha and her mother navigate their changed relationship and the mysteries surrounding their family, they experience the wrath of Gran Mae's rose-petal apparition during a tense dinner. Gran Mae holds Samantha and Phil hostage, using rose whips to bind and cut them. Samantha's mother defies Gran Mae, arguing that she is being unreasonable and demanding an impossible standard of normalcy. Desperate to protect her mother, Samantha confronts Gran Mae and demands her to stop her tirade.\n\nIn a strange turn of events, the house appears to fall into a sinkhole, plunging Samantha, her mother, and Phil into darkness. The windows show only dirt and darkness, leaving them questioning their reality. As they struggle to comprehend the situation and find a way out, Samantha remains determined to uncover the truth behind the supernatural events surrounding her family's home and the mysterious origins of the darkness that surrounds them. Gail suggests that they may need the roses to protect them, as Gran Mae's magic had been tied to the roses.\n\nAs Samantha, her mother, Phil, and Gail find themselves trapped on the roof of the house with the terrifying underground children breaking in, they must find a way to escape and uncover the truth behind the strange occurrences in their home. Samantha harnesses the power of the roses, managing to repel the underground children temporarily, but leaving her family still trapped and needing to find a solution to their dire situation.\n\nGail explains that the underground children are hybrids created by Elgar Mills, Samantha's great-grandfather, who had used ritual magic to infuse his essence with something elemental in the earth. The children had likely rebelled against him and were attracted to the house due to its strong connection to Gran Mae. Samantha, her mother, and Phil manage to escape the underground trap with the help of Gail's vulture, Hermes, who had briefly become a glowing, angelic figure.\n\nThe official explanation for the house's collapse is a sinkhole, and the insurance company pays for the damages. Samantha and her mother decide to move to Arizona with Brad, while Gail remains behind to look after Phil and the rest of the neighborhood. Before leaving, Samantha asks Gail if the underground children are truly gone, and Gail suggests that they may still be alive, but their slow movement and weakened state make them less of an immediate threat. Nonetheless, Gail advises Samantha and her family to put distance between themselves and the creatures, just in case.\n\nSamantha and her mother prepare for their move to Arizona, with Samantha promising to keep in touch with Phil and Gail. As they leave their old home and the mysteries it held behind, Samantha contemplates the strange powers and events that had unfolded on Lammergeier Lane, and the lessons she had learned about family, loyalty, and the importance of facing the unknown."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-12T21:31:12.083178Z","updated_at":"2023-09-17T13:25:04.402990Z","inner_id":3,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":52,"updated_by":8,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6585,"annotations":[{"id":2290,"completed_by":8,"result":[{"value":{"text":["1.

She leaves her mother behind and joins a group of women called the Blooms, who work as hostesses in an elite club called the Loop Club. The Blooms form a bond, sharing stories and supporting each other. Rose finds herself attracted to the Barber, a local hunter who seems to be an outsider.

He faces challenges in connecting with his disinterested students and finds solace in a friendship with Wolfe, a Digger who shares his skepticism about the camp's management and the land's suitability for building. Grant also forms a romantic relationship with Willow, one of the Blooms, but feels guilty for not thinking about his girlfriend Jane during their time together.\n\nIn another part of the story, a group of eight women works together at a climate research station called White Alice in the Far North. They support each other and adapt to their isolated environment, even creating a map of their territory and naming it after their station. Sal, the leader of the group, undergoes a significant transformation during her time at White Alice, becoming more disillusioned with the world they left behind and the dominance of men.\n\nAs Rose and Grant navigate their new lives, they become involved with the mysterious project at Dominion Lake, led by Meyer, a charming and well-groomed man with a love for Ethio jazz and a shared history as a Walden graduate. Meyer reveals his disillusionment with his earlier ideals, believing that there are too many humans competing for limited resources. Despite this, he still thinks that change is possible if people band together.\n\nAt a New Year's Eve celebration in 2050, Rose is seated between Reilly, a PR shill for the camp, and the Foreman, who oversees the Diggers working on the project. The Foreman confronts Rose in the bathroom, revealing that he is her contact from Damien, who has promised her that the Floating City will be a safe haven for her and her mother. This revelation leaves Rose feeling uneasy, as she now must navigate her relationships with Meyer, the Barber, and the Foreman while staying true to her mission.\n\nMeanwhile, the women at White Alice prepare to leave their station and head to Dominion Lake, guided by the coordinates tattooed on their skin. As they make their final preparations, a mysterious black helicopter arrives, carrying a young man and woman who seem less threatening than anticipated.\n\nThe story highlights the contrast between the virtual world people are immersed in and the genuine connections and experiences that can be found in the real world. Both Rose and Grant grapple with their pasts and the expectations placed on them, seeking to break free from their predetermined paths and find a more authentic and meaningful life.

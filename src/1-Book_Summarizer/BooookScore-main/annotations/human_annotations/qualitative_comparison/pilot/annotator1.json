Level of detail: I believe summary 1 does a better job here. \nIt has more moments captured in its summary than that of 2. For instance, in Summary 1 we learn about Tony's aspirations and current marital and employment status. Also, we learn his current employer is underpaying him, about Oliver's family background, and that Tammy started working with Kip\/Oliver. While Summary 2 talks about Tony's life before moving to the US, it fails to cover any other aspect in greater detail.\n\n2. Overall structure and pace: I prefer Summary 2.\nWhile Summary 1 is more detailed, it's somewhat all over the place. For example, it includes a lot of extra information we don't need, like \"Meanwhile, Tammy finds solace in her friendship with Yumi and dreams of wealth and freedom.\" and filler sentences like \"They must confront the challenges and consequences of their actions and choices.\" While I feel Summary 2 glossed over a lot of detail, it did a good job of structuring. The intro is nice as it eases you into what the summary is about. Then, it goes over events chronologically and logically.\n\n3. Logic and understandability: Summary 2 wins here as well.\nSummary 1 simply had too many filler sentences that made it hard to follow at times. Also, there was a point in the second to last paragraph that made it look like she was going to the police, but then it skipped to her traveling to her birthplace. Summary 2 isn't free of this issue as well, with this example as proof: \"Tammy, now a freshman at Harvard, meets with her uncle Oliver, who has been invited back to the university to join the board of the Crimson Pride Alumni Association.\" - here it seems we have two Olivers, but considering the fact Tony left China with only his wife and daughter, it seems unlikely the Oliver being referenced here is her biological uncle. However, despite this, Summary 2 is more cohesive. It has way less filler sentences and does a better job of simplifying text.\n\n4. Whether there are contradictions between the two summaries or if some important information is present in one summary but omitted in the other. \nThere are no contradictions, but one piece of information is missing.\nIn Summary 1, we find that Tony had a heart attack, which, despite how serious it is, wasn't covered at all in Summary 2."]},"id":"TvDJRXakoo","from_name":"thoughts","to_name":"summary_1","type":"textarea","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-09-15T06:52:25.115216Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T06:52:25.115273Z","lead_time":1806.334,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"294e85ff-c856-45f4-ac69-8611f354c4b0","last_action":null,"task":6487,"project":51,"updated_by":5,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"ca372128-data_daniel.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"book":"paper-names.epub","summary_1":"Tony, a Chinese immigrant and engineer, works as a doorman at the prestigious Rosewood building in America, struggling to adapt to his new life and dealing with challenges, such as raising his stubborn daughter Tammy and maintaining his marriage to Kim, a former medical doctor.

Tony was once a successful engineer in China, but he left that life behind in pursuit of the American Dream. He works as a doorman at an Upper West Side co-op building called The Rosewood while attending computer science classes at Queens College. Tony's wife, Kim, who used to be a medical doctor in China, now works at a bakery and believes in the power of traditional medicine. Their daughter, Tammy, is passionate about playing the piano and struggles with her father's strict discipline.\n\nOne day, Tony witnesses a resident, Clara Abadi, a former movie star, being attacked and robbed outside the building. He springs into action, fighting off the attacker and retrieving her stolen purse. Clara, despite being injured, publicly praises Tony as her savior. Meanwhile, Oliver, a young lawyer living in The Rosewood, is being groomed by his mentor, Kip Appleton, to take on a new client, Evan, a college dropout who has launched a digital music start-up. Oliver pretends to be interested in Evan's hobbies, like reading fantasy books and attending comic book conventions, in order to win his business.\n\nOliver is dating Janna, a kind and open-minded woman who works with children with terminal cancer. After a year of dating, Janna hints that she wants more from their relationship, making Oliver wonder if he could ever tell her the truth about his family. Worried that she might eventually resent or pity him, he focuses on work instead. When Tony is hospitalized after saving Clara, Oliver offers to help Tony, who is worried about getting in trouble with the police and possibly losing his work visa. Oliver, a lawyer, promises to help Tony for free, considering him a friend.\n\nTammy, now a freshman at Harvard, meets with her uncle Oliver, who has been invited back to the university to join the board of the Crimson Pride Alumni Association. Oliver reminisces about his time at Harvard and how much he misses it. As they walk around campus, Tammy discusses her experiences and the people she has met, including her potential boyfriend, Sang-tae. Oliver feels a strange attraction to Tammy, which he tries to suppress.\n\nTony becomes involved in a hit-and-run accident caused by Kip, with Oliver as a passenger. Kip convinces Oliver to keep quiet about the accident, fearing the consequences for Kip. Tammy, grieving her father's death, finds comfort in her friendship with Oliver and begins to develop feelings for him. Despite their shared grief and the challenges they face, Oliver and Tammy find solace in each other's company.\n\nAs Tony and Tammy spend time together in the hospital, they discuss their past and Tony's reasons for moving to America. He explains that he left China in search of a better life and more opportunities for himself and his family. Tony is aware that there would always be a ceiling for him, but he believes that in America, there is no ceiling for Tammy. He is determined to change and improve himself, not only for his own sake but also for the sake of his daughter.\n\nThe story shifts to 1989, focusing on Tongheng, a university professor in Dalian, China. He visits his colleague Dawei's apartment with his wife Kuan-yin and their baby girl. Dawei has recently returned from a research project in America and shares his experiences, including introducing them to Oreos. The story implies that Tongheng is Tammy's father, and the narrative explores his experiences and relationships in China before moving to the United States.\n\nTongheng's background is revealed through his memories and conversations with Kuan-yin. He grew up in a poor family, where he learned the importance of money and the power it could bring. His father was a harsh and abusive man, and Tongheng swore to break the cycle of violence with his own family. In contrast, Kuan-yin grew up in an upper-middle-class family and had a more comfortable upbringing. The couple's differing backgrounds occasionally cause tension between them, as they each have different perspectives on life and success.\n\nDawei's success in America and his recent promotion at work further fuel Tongheng's feelings of jealousy and envy.

As he contemplates the idea of moving to America, he wrestles with his own insecurities and the potential risks involved in uprooting his family's life.\n\nIn the end, Oliver and Tammy must confront their feelings for one another and decide whether to reveal the truth about the hit-and-run accident. Oliver, unable to keep the secret any longer, confesses to Tammy that he was in the car that killed her father. He claims it was an accident and that Kip, who was driving, couldn't see her dad in the dark. Tammy is horrified and accuses Oliver of covering up the crime.

In Trier, the group visits the Porta Nigra and discusses their backgrounds while bonding over shared experiences.\n\nThe protagonist then recalls their past as a registered nurse and their journey to discover their true identity. After meeting Tenzo, a mysterious man who shares similarities with Hiruko, they become his caretaker and the two develop a romantic relationship. However, Tenzo's sudden departure to Norway leaves them feeling abandoned and uncertain about their future. In the meantime, the protagonist is confronted by a man named Reinhart Reichmann, who questions the cancellation of the Umami Festival at the Karl Marx House. The protagonist wonders about the true reasons behind the cancellation and how it might connect to Hiruko and her quest to find her lost people.\n\nAs the group explores Trier, they meet again in the ancient ruins of Kaiserthermen, where the protagonist informs them about the cancellation of the Umami Festival. Surprised and curious about Tenzo's inability to return from Oslo, the group ponders the reasons behind these events and how they might be interconnected. They learn of a terrorist attack in Oslo, which may have caused tightened border security, preventing Tenzo from returning. The group decides to travel to Oslo, hoping to uncover the truth of their intertwined fates and continue their journey of self-discovery.\n\nIn Copenhagen, the protagonist experiences homesickness for flavors of the sea from their Greenland home. They meet Anira, an Indian girl from the language school, who tells them about a restaurant called Samurai where they can eat raw fish.

Instead, they meet a man called Nanook, who claims to be Tenzo but speaks their native language with an unusual accent. They learn that Nanook is an Eskimo who has mastered Hiruko's language and works as a sushi chef. Nanook reveals that there is someone in Arles who speaks the same language as Hiruko, and the group decides to travel there next.\n\nAs they travel to Kiel, the protagonist finds love with a girl named Anke, and they begin to settle down, opening a sushi restaurant together. However, the protagonist becomes obsessed with a woman named Carmen, who appears in their life unexpectedly. Their obsession with Carmen leads them to follow her to Arles, where they encounter her and a man who violently beats them. The protagonist ends up in the hospital, and their journey of self-discovery takes a new turn as they face the consequences of their obsession and their relationships with Hiruko, Anke, and Carmen. In Arles, they meet Nora, who tells them she has heard about their past from Nanook and Wolf, a man they ran a sushi restaurant with in Husum. Nora introduces the protagonist to other individuals who have come to see them, and they wonder about the connections between these people and their own journey.\n\nIn Arles, the protagonist converses with Susanoo, a sushi chef who speaks Hiruko's language. They try to engage him in conversation, but Susanoo remains mostly silent, as if frightened. Nanook arrives, introducing himself to Susanoo and explaining that he learned their language through self-study.

Susanoo's eyes fill with tears, but he ultimately remains silent, and the group's journey continues.\n\nAt a restaurant in Arles, the protagonist encounters his mother, who questions Nanook's whereabouts and accuses him of leaving her behind. The protagonist defends Nanook, and tensions rise in the conversation as the protagonist's mother accuses him of being jealous and not understanding her relationship with Nanook.

Although he remains voiceless, everyone in the group listens intently and seems to understand what he is saying without hearing his voice. Akash expresses a desire to accompany Susanoo to a place where they study loss of speech, and the rest of the group agrees to go together. The protagonist now sees Susanoo not as someone who is sick but as someone with his own unique language, and the group's journey of self-discovery and understanding continues as they set off for their next destination.","summary_2":"\"Scattered All Over the Earth\" follows the journey of a young linguistics student named Knut, living in Denmark, who becomes captivated by Hiruko, a mysterious woman from an archipelago between China and Polynesia. Hiruko speaks a \"homemade language\" called Panska and works at the Märchen Center, where she helps immigrant children learn about Europe through fairy tales and communicates with them in Panska through picture dramas called kamishibai. Knut meets Hiruko after seeing her on a television program and becomes determined to learn more about her unique language. They bond over their shared interest in linguistics, and Hiruko reveals that she is from a country that no longer exists.\n\nThe story explores themes of language, communication, identity, and the impact of technology on the natural world. Knut, Hiruko, and their friends, Akash and Nanook, travel to various locations in search of someone who speaks Hiruko's native language. They first go to Trier, Germany, to attend an umami festival, where they meet Akash, an Indian man in charge of hosting a gathering of Indian students studying in Germany. The group explores the city, discussing ancient Roman culture, caste systems, and the changing nature of the human body.\n\nKnut, Hiruko, and Akash eventually travel to Oslo in search of someone who speaks Hiruko's native language. However, their plans are complicated when Knut's mother insists on joining him on the trip. Knut lies to her about being in Copenhagen for a symposium and sends Akash to Oslo in his place. In Oslo, they encounter a controversy involving a dead whale and the possible arrest of Nanook, an Eskimo sushi chef who speaks Hiruko's language. Nanook is eventually declared innocent, and Akash tells the protagonist that their next destination will be Arles, France, where they will meet someone else who speaks Hiruko's language.\n\nThe protagonist's journey to understand the world around them and their relationships with others is interwoven with the stories of the robots their father creates and the changes their town undergoes due to the nuclear power plant industry. As they navigate these challenges, they form a bond and support each other through their shared experiences.\n\nWhile in Arles, the group's dynamics become more complicated when Knut's mother unexpectedly shows up at the restaurant where they are meeting Susanoo, a sushi chef who shares their native language but has lost his ability to speak. Hiruko tries to engage Susanoo in conversation, but he remains mostly silent and unresponsive throughout their interaction. Knut's mother is upset with Nanook for abandoning his studies, which she had sponsored, and confronts him about his whereabouts and plans. She disapproves of the relationships within the group and tries to assert her authority over her son and Nanook.\n\nThroughout their journey, the characters struggle with issues of identity, language, and communication. Hiruko speaks Panska, a language that allows her to maintain her individuality while still being understood by others. The characters also grapple with their roles within the group and their relationships with each other, as well as their connections to their native countries and cultures.\n\nIn one scene, Susanoo, who appears to be mute, begins to make a speech without any sound. Despite his lack of voice, the other characters seem to understand him, and even the protagonist's mother listens intently. Nanook watches Susanoo with admiration, hoping to one day speak with such confidence. Hiruko, who should not be able to hear Susanoo, smiles and nods in agreement to his speech, indicating that she understands him as well. The protagonist realizes that Susanoo is not sick, but rather has his own unique language.\n\nAkash, another friend, suddenly claims to understand Susanoo's desire to visit a place where they study speech loss. He offers to accompany Susanoo on the trip. The protagonist, feeling jealous, asks Akash if he can hear Susanoo's voice. Nora responds on Akash's behalf, explaining that they can understand Susanoo even without hearing him. Hiruko expresses happiness about the prospect of traveling together, and Nanook agrees. The protagonist's mother has left the restaurant, and the protagonist suggests that they all go together on this journey.\n\n\"Scattered All Over the Earth\" is a story that delves into the complexities of language, communication, and identity. The characters' shared experiences and challenges form a bond between them as they navigate their personal and interpersonal conflicts. The story also serves as a commentary on the power of language as both a tool for connection and separation, as well as the impact of technology on the natural world."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-12T19:10:08.434949Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T07:11:52.207993Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":51,"updated_by":5,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6489,"annotations":[{"id":2278,"completed_by":5,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"NttNuaNlzu","from_name":"preference","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["1.

He begins an apprenticeship in the art of perfumery under the tutelage of his father, Mohan, and his uncle, Vivek. The story is set against the backdrop of growing political turmoil in India, as demands for independence and the possibility of partition loom.\n\nSamir meets Firdaus, the daughter of a master calligrapher named ustad Altaf Hussain Khan, whose family has different religious beliefs. Despite their differences, they forge a deep connection. However, their relationship is met with disapproval, particularly by Firdaus's mother, Zainab, who warns her daughter about the consequences of their friendship.\n\nAs religious tensions and political unrest rise in Lahore, Samir's friend Prithvi encourages him to join a group fighting to keep Lahore from being divided between India and Pakistan. Firdaus's parents also struggle with their daughter's relationship with Samir. Altaf questions the need for partition, while Zainab insists that Firdaus marry her cousin Fahad. As violence escalates, both families take measures to protect themselves, and Samir writes hopeful letters to Firdaus.\n\nThe Partition eventually occurs, and Samir flees Lahore by train, only surviving a massacre thanks to his Muslim friends. He is devastated to find his family dead amidst the rubble when he returns to Lahore. Samir gives Altaf a letter for Firdaus and receives her maroon dupatta, a symbol of their love.\n\nYears after the Partition, Samir settles in Paris with the help of Ehsan's family in Delhi and Léa Clement, a French nurse whom he marries, having a daughter named Sophie. He discovers a wartime photograph of his uncle, Vivek Nath Vij, who had served in the British Indian Army during World War I, and becomes intrigued by his uncle's life as a soldier. He begins reading Vivek's journals, learning about his escape to and eventual solace found in Grasse, a town of perfumers in France.\n\nAs Samir reads the journals, he uncovers details about Vivek's relationship with Iqbal Khan, a fellow soldier and calligrapher connected to Firdaus's family. Samir becomes engrossed in both the art of perfumery and the tragic elements of his uncle's life, such as his marriage to a French woman named Ambrette and the birth and death of their child, Anouk.\n\nOverwhelmed by his uncle's experiences and the burden of their lost love, Samir becomes consumed by Vivek's journals, causing tension with Léa. Meanwhile, in Lahore, Firdaus is haunted by memories of Samir and struggles to adjust to her new life married to Fahad. She tries to find solace in drawing, but is constantly reminded of her love for Samir.\n\nBy 1959, Samir arrives in Grasse to further explore Vivek's past and meets with Édouard deRose and his son Gaspard, a French perfumer. Gaspard shares stories about Vivek and Ambrette's love and recounts the tragedies and challenges Vivek faced, including the loss of his sense of smell after Ambrette's death.\n\nThroughout the story, characters grapple with the complexities of love, tradition, friendship, and the impact of war and political conflict on their lives. The art of calligraphy and perfume-making serve as a unifying force, providing a sense of comfort and stability in uncertain times. Despite the challenges they face, Samir and Firdaus hold onto their promise to find a way back to each other, no matter the outcome of the political turmoil that divides India and Pakistan.\n\nIn the final chapters, Samir Khan, Firdaus's grandson, travels to Paris to return a box of letters to the old perfumer, Samir Vij. The two bond over their shared history and the importance of memory in their lives. Anouk, Samir Vij's granddaughter, learns about her family's history and the art of perfumery from her grandfather. As they work on a perfume inspired by Firdaus, Samir Vij passes away, leaving Anouk with a sense of purpose and a deeper understanding of her family's past."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-12T19:10:08.435101Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T17:17:31.547722Z","inner_id":3,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":51,"updated_by":5,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6490,"annotations":[{"id":2279,"completed_by":5,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 1"]},"id":"_ghpu8_OHH","from_name":"preference","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["1.

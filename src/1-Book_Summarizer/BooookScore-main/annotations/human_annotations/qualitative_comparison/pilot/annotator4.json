The first summary has a higher level of detail since it describes more events - it mentions Proctor flirting with Thea, the boat tribute to Cynthia, the return to an old room with a new paint job, Proctor being accused of murdering a watchman, the full names of certain side characters, and so on - but fails to include important details about the setting, such as the explanation for what the \"monitors\" are and how Prospera is sectioned off from the rest of the world. In this respect, the second summary may have less details, but the ones it does include are generally more pertinent.\n","The pace of the first summary is that of a breakneck speed. It immediately describes Proctor's job, how he's considering a career change and his interactions with his father and the girl Caeli in just the first paragraph. The second summary, however, is paced and structured much better: It establishes the setting in the first paragraph with some details about Prospera, the protagonist and the brewing conflict with the Arrivalists, and then dedicates each subsequent paragraph to one or two key plot points at most while also taking breaks to mention the themes of the story and some of the characters' internal conflicts.\n","The logic and understandability of the second summary definitely exceeds the first. For example, the first summary includes a paragraph about how Proctor has been shot and is dying, which is then immediately followed by a paragraph about Proctor \"staying behind\" to \"care for the remaining investors\" in stasis. Not only has the stasis and the importance of the \"investors\" not been explained at this point, it should also be impossible for Proctor to care for anyone if he's been shot to death. The second summary has some logical issues. It says Caeli is just some missing girl in the second paragraph but later states she is Proctor's daughter in the fifth. However, it is still more understandable than the first thanks to its pacing, structure and inclusion of important details.\n","Information is sometimes included in one summary, but not the other. For instance, the first summary states that Proctor is a \"ferryman\" who helps people transition into new lives, while the second says he is a civil servant (more specifically, a managing director for social contracts). Contradictions also exist between the two briefs. For example, the first summary says Proctor stays behind from the boat ride later in the story to care for \"investors\" (as mentioned earlier when comparing the logic of the two summaries) while the second says he not only sailed on the boat to find his missing companions, but that he also rebuilt that boat himself. This last detail may be another contradiction, since the only boat mentioned in the first summary states that it was built by Proctor's father as a tribute to his late mother Cynthia, not by Proctor himself.\n"]},"id":"TOYzpagRgw","from_name":"thoughts","to_name":"summary_1","type":"textarea","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-09-15T13:01:10.914548Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T13:01:10.914592Z","lead_time":70409.099,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"2b4dbc82-6471-4b3b-b734-a1129fe282b3","last_action":null,"task":6502,"project":54,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"1f9e8f25-data_patrice.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"book":"the-ferryman.epub","summary_1":"Proctor Bennett, a ferryman in Prospera, assists people transitioning to new lives upon retirement.

The citizens of Prospera enjoy long, fulfilling lives, monitored by devices embedded in their forearms that measure their physical health and psychological well-being. Proctor Bennett, the protagonist, is a 42-year-old civil servant working as a managing director for District Six of the Department of Social Contracts, Enforcement Division. He is married to Elise, and they live in a beautiful home on Prospera's southern coast. Unrest is brewing among the Support Staff, ordinary men and women who provide labor to keep Prospera running. They begin to question their place in the social order, and rumors spread of a resistance group called \"Arrivalists\" who may be planning a revolution.\n\nProctor's life takes an unexpected turn when he is summoned to retire his own father, Malcolm Bennett, who gives him a cryptic message before being taken away on the ferry. As Proctor begins to experience dreams and his monitor percentage starts to drop alarmingly fast, his wife, Elise, expresses concern for his well-being and suggests he consider a career change. They bond over their shared experiences and start looking for a missing girl named Caeli.\n\nMeanwhile, Cynthia, a woman who has done everything possible to slow down the aging process, reminisces about the days when she first met her adopted ward, Proctor, and how he brought joy and purpose to her life. The story explores themes of aging, societal expectations, and the search for truth in a seemingly perfect world.\n\nDuring the chaos, Proctor becomes increasingly determined to uncover the truth behind his father's cryptic message, Caeli's disappearance, and the unrest in Prospera. He meets a blind painter named Pappi who he suspects might be part of the Arrivalist movement. Pappi and Proctor's mother, Cynthia, who reveals herself to be a member of the Arrivalists, urge Proctor to join the cause. Otto Winspear, a high-ranking government official, investigates the deaths of a woman named Jessica Ordway and a man named Hanson, as he believes their connection to Arrivalists holds the key to unraveling their mysterious organization.\n\nSeeking answers and driven by concern for his daughter, Caeli, Proctor recklessly breaks into a government facility to rescue her from a mysterious holding area called remand. Proctor is caught in the act and ultimately taken to the enigmatic Nursery, where he encounters a dream-like state and meets a woman named Dr. Patty. Proctor manages to escape to a place called the Annex, a section of the city, where he rebuilds a boat called Oranios with the help of friends and fellow rebels, such as Thea, Quinn, and Antone. Together, they set sail across the Veil, a mysterious barrier that separates their world from the unknown.\n\nAs they approach the Veil, Proctor has a vision of a futuristic city and encounters the mechanical version of Bernardo, who informs him that he is in the recovery area. He reunites with Thea and Quinn, who look older and different, and together they explore this strange new world in search of their missing companions, including Caeli and Proctor's mother Cynthia.\n\nThe story then delves into the background of Project Oranios, an ambitious mission to establish a human settlement on an exoplanet called Caelus, capable of supporting human life. Dr. Malcolm Bennett, Proctor's father, is interviewed about the project and its implications for humanity. He explains that he is undertaking this mission for the future of his daughter and the human species, as he believes that Earth has reached a tipping point and will soon be unable to support life. The spacecraft Oranios is the largest ever built, with a method of propulsion that involves massive particle collectors, similar to sails. The journey to Caelus will take 230 years, and the challenge of keeping 80,000 people alive for such a long period leads to the development of consciousness integration, a new form of stasis.\n\nAs Proctor undertakes a desperate mission to uncover the truth behind his father's death, the unrest in Prospera, and the mysterious Nursery, he is forced to confront his own beliefs and question the true nature of the utopian society in which he lives. Ultimately, Proctor and his allies stand against the oppressive government and attempt to reveal the truth about Prospera, the Nursery, and the Arrivalists that have been hiding in plain sight. The Ferryman explores themes of aging, societal expectations, and the search for truth in a seemingly perfect world, as characters grapple with their own identities and the true nature of their existence."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-12T19:12:19.793000Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T13:01:10.985756Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":54,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6503,"annotations":[{"id":2283,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"8MwgXHdSvJ","from_name":"preference","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["The level of detail in both summaries is about even, with the two mentioning many names, places and descriptions of key events in the story of \"The Marriage Portrait.\" However, while the first summary describes more events, such as an instance where Lucrezia \"avoids the flirtatious gaze of the artist\" and the mention of Lucrezia being ordered to cut her hair, the second summary includes more general details, such as the name of the book and the themes it explores.\n","The overall structure and pace of the two summaries is very different. The first is very fast-paced, moving from event to event and only occasionally stopping to mention Lucrezia's internal struggles and the difficulty she has with navigating her relationships in the family. The second has a slower pace, making mention of the story's themes and Lucrezia's internal conflict more frequently and only focusing on one or two key events at a time per paragraph. For example, when describing the visit from the physician, the first summary only mentions that he was summoned by Alfonso, his \"concerns about Lucrecia's character,\" the physician's advice and Alfonso's orders. The second summary, on the other hand, spends time explaining that the physician was summoned to examine Lucrezia's declining health (the first summary doesn't even mention it's on the decline to begin with), that Alfonso worries Lucrezia is somehow preventing a pregnancy through willpower, how the doctor dismisses and addresses this notion, and finally, how Lucrezia deals with this information: she is struggling to reconcile Alfonso's cruelty with his apparent kindness.\n","The second summary is more logical and understandable overall. For example, when mentioning the portrait artists, the first summary says Lucrezia meets Bastianino during \"a portrait session\" while she \"avoids [his] flirtatious gaze\" and befriends \"the apprentice Jacopo\" who will \"keep her secrets safe.\" What these secrets are, who Jacopo is an apprentice to, or even whose portrait is being drawn are not clearly explained, so these two sentences feel logically disconnected from the story and hard to understand. The second summary, on the other hand, doesn't even mention Bastianino (likely because he is not an important character in the story overall) and skips straight to Jacopo, making mention of how he is an apprentice artist who is doing her portrait. It also specifically mentions that she is confiding in him about her entire situation and how Jacopo is offering her a chance to escape, something the first summary only vaguely alludes to at its very end.\n","There aren't contradictions between the two summaries, but there are some details and information that are present in one and not the other, as seen in the examples listed previously. For another example, both summaries end very differently: The first states Lucrezia hopes to meet with Jacopo \"in the trees\" to \"escape to a city of uncertainty\" while the second makes no mention of the trees or the city, just that she chooses to escape with Jacopo over staying with Alfonso. The second summary also mentions an alternate conclusion where Lucrezia stays with Alfonso and is later found dead and beaten in her bed and how the story is historical fiction, none of which is mentioned in the first summary.\n"]},"id":"-ecMM0Uw55","from_name":"thoughts","to_name":"summary_1","type":"textarea","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-09-16T20:50:23.195704Z","updated_at":"2023-09-16T20:50:23.195763Z","lead_time":413.674,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"af64771e-6bd5-4238-9633-d3680cca02e0","last_action":null,"task":6503,"project":54,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"1f9e8f25-data_patrice.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"book":"the-marriage-portrait.epub","summary_1":"In 1561, 16-year-old Lucrezia fears her husband, Alfonso, plans to kill her.

The story is set in various locations, including a fortified hunting lodge near the Po River, the Florentine palazzo, and the marshy land near the coast of Tuscany. The novel explores themes of power, ambition, and the dangers faced by women in a male-dominated society.\n\nThe story begins with sixteen-year-old Lucrezia dining with her husband Alfonso at a remote, fortified hunting lodge, where she suddenly realizes that he intends to kill her. The narrative shifts to a flashback of Lucrezia's mother, Eleonora, in Florence in 1544. Eleonora, a powerful and intelligent woman, is focused on securing the future of their dynasty and the power of their region. As Lucrezia grows, she becomes increasingly difficult and intractable, causing concern for Eleonora who fears her wild behavior will influence her other children.\n\nAs a sixteen-year-old bride, Lucrezia discovers that her husband, Alfonso, a duke and soldier, plans to kill her, and she must find a way to survive. Remembering the lessons of her childhood, she realizes that she needs a plan to outsmart her husband. As she sits at dinner with him, she forces herself to smile and act normal while secretly plotting her escape. Throughout the story, Lucrezia struggles with her feelings of loneliness and her desire to understand the motivations of those around her. She tries to navigate the complex world of her ruling family and the expectations placed on her and her siblings.\n\nIn one part of the story, Lucrezia wakes up in an unfamiliar room after her wedding night with Alfonso and wonders how often she will have to endure the pain and discomfort of their union. As she walks outside, she marvels at the beauty of the landscape and the freedom she feels. She is surprised to see that the heavy wooden doors of the villa are open and unguarded, a sign of the peaceful and secure nature of the place. \n\nLucrezia's relationship with her husband becomes strained, and she is increasingly concerned for her safety. She suspects that Alfonso and his consigliere, Leonello, are plotting against her. When she overhears a woman screaming in the castello, she learns that Alfonso has executed a man named Contrari for compromising the honor of his sister, Elisabetta. Lucrezia is horrified by Alfonso's actions and begins to question her loyalty to him.\n\nIn the midst of her struggles, Lucrezia forms a connection with Jacopo, an apprentice artist who has been working on her portrait. He warns her of the danger she faces and offers her a chance to escape her situation. As they part, Lucrezia is left to contemplate her options and the possibility of a different life.\n\nLucrezia's health begins to decline, and Alfonso summons a physician to examine her, hoping she might be pregnant. The physician determines that it is unlikely Lucrezia is with child and recommends a strict regimen of diet, rest, and abstinence from certain activities to improve her health and increase her chances of becoming pregnant. Alfonso, frustrated by the news, confides in the doctor his suspicion that Lucrezia is somehow preventing pregnancy through her willpower or a flaw in her character. The doctor dismisses this notion, attributing her condition to an excess of heat in her blood, which he believes can be treated through bleeding, cupping, and herbal remedies.\n\nAs Lucrezia eavesdrops on their conversation, she contemplates the many sides of Alfonso's personality and struggles to reconcile his recent acts of cruelty with his current kindness and concern for her well-being. She also wrestles with her own feelings of fear, resentment, and longing for escape from her life in Ferrara. Despite the restrictions placed on her, Lucrezia finds solace in small acts of rebellion and spends time with her maid, Emilia.\n\nIn a climactic scene, Lucrezia is convinced that Alfonso plans to kill her and must choose between staying in the fortress, where she believes she will be poisoned and die, or escaping into the unknown and risking being hunted down by Alfonso and his men. She ultimately chooses to escape with the help of Jacopo.\n\nIn an alternate narrative, Lucrezia is found dead in her bed, her face brutally battered and ravaged by an alleged seizure. The Duke Alfonso, devastated by her death, shuts himself away in his room. The author's note reveals that the story is inspired by the lives of Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, and Lucrezia di Cosimo de' Medici d'Este, Duchess of Ferrara. Some historical details have been altered for the sake of fiction, such as the timeline of Lucrezia's marriage and departure to Ferrara.\n\nThroughout the story, Lucrezia demonstrates her inner strength and resilience in the face of her challenging circumstances. Despite the difficulties she faces in her marriage and the potential dangers that lie ahead, she remains determined to navigate her way through them and find a way to survive and thrive."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-09-12T19:12:19.793184Z","updated_at":"2023-09-16T20:50:23.262209Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":54,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6504,"annotations":[{"id":2284,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Summary 2"]},"id":"R-ir4a6mYy","from_name":"preference","to_name":"summary_1","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"text":["The level of detail in both summaries is similar when describing the plot points in \"The Night Travelers\", but the second summary is more detailed.

They both recount the events of the book in the same order and don't linger on any key events for too long, generally keeping to one or two per paragraph. The most significant difference with their structures is that the first summary takes pauses to reflect on the themes of the story while the second one doesn't.\n","The second summary is more logical and understandable. The first spends so much time explaining the themes of the story that it barely summarizes its events: the first four paragraphs actually recount events, but the last 3 focus almost entirely on the story's themes and how it's historical fiction. It also jumps around chronologically a lot in the second paragraph: it begins by mentioning how Lillith married Martin and conceived Nadine, and then jumps backwards in time to explain Lillith's family business for two sentences only to jump forward again to Martin kissing Lillith and re-explaining how they conceived Nadine. The second summary doesn't do any of this, simply recounting important events in the story with occasional pauses that mention important details and the internal struggles of the main characters.\n","No contradictions exist between the two summaries, but some information is present in one and not the other.

It begins with Lilith, a mixed-race girl born to Ally Keller, a German woman, and Marcus, a black musician. Lilith and her mother face discrimination under the Nazi regime in Germany and find solace with their neighbor, Herr Professor Bruno Bormann, who serves as Lilith's tutor and father figure. To protect Lilith from persecution, Herr Professor and Ally arrange for her to leave Germany with the Herzogs, a Jewish family, passing as a Jew herself.\n\nIn Havana, Lilith is adopted by the Herzogs and befriends Martín Bernal, who becomes her husband and father of their daughter, Nadine.

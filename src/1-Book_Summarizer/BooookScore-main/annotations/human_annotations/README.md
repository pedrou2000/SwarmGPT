- `annotations-gpt4-4096-inc.json` contains annotations where annotators decide whether they agree with a given annotation (both human and GPT-4 annotations are included) for incremental summaries generated by GPT-4 with a chunk size of 4096. See paper Section 4 - Validating BooookScore.
- `summary-gpt4-4096-hier.json` contains annotations for hierarchical summaries generated by GPT-4 with a chunk size of 4096.

    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)

    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two

    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
